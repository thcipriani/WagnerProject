Leaving New Guinea was a difficult choice for Reverend Bill and Mrs. Ruth
Wagner. They had spent fourteen years of their life in New Guinea and all
of their children had been born there. Therefore it was understandable
that they would have mixed feelings about taking up a new life back home
in the United States.

Newly married and full of enthusiasm, they had arrived in March 1955, to
bring the word of Christ to the peoples in the highlands of New Guinea.
What made them more uneasy were stories they had heard about how much
more difficult it was to adjust to life in their homeland than it was
to adjust to life in a foreign land.

But, the Wagner children were growing up and a decision had to be made
about their future. The Reverend Bill and Mrs. Ruth Wagner were torn
between staying in Enga-land, or doing what was best for their daughters.

As Reverend Wagner struggled with this, he finally came to a decision -

	[Put this para in Italics]
	Next We have weighed the call to New Guinea to serve Engas with the
	Word of God and feel that after 14 years to want to serve the Lord
	elsewhere is not denouncing His call to serve Engas as a lesser
	call but merely a decision to try to do the best we can for our
	children, His gifts to us, while at the same time endeavoring to
	continue to serve in a new situation. We do not feel that it is wise
	nor expedient to do one task at the expense of another when both
	are incumbent upon us" [Wagner Newsletter, November 28, 1968].

The facts were that one teenage daughter was already 3,000 miles away
attending one of the secondary schools in Australia and another daughter
would be going there in two years to also further her education. The
Wagners realized that this was a difficult task for any child to endure.
One of their daughters was living most of the time away from home and
another would follow. As parents, Reverend and Mrs. Ruth Wagner
understood the isolation their daughter felt and they did not want to
continue being separated from her or their other daughters for most of
the time.

In the decision to leave for the USA, Mrs. Ruth Wagner looks back to the
joy of her first memories of being in New Guinea -

	[Put in italics]
	Our first Christmas there and how it had meant so much to us because
	Sarah, our first born, had arrived one month earlier.  But now, Sarah
	would be returning home from Luther College in Melbourne [Australia]
	to New Guinea for the family’s last Christmas together before going to
	America. [Wagner Newsletter. 1968]

Although their future [at that time] was quite indefinite, the Wagners had
found a new peace in their decision. Reverend Wagner made inquiries about
studying again before accepting a call into the parish ministry. In the
meantime, the Wagners would follow God’s guiding hand. It had been arranged
that another Pastor and his wife would replace them at their last mission
station in Sirunki. In all, the Wagners were in New Guinea from 1955 at
Raiakama, moved to Mambisanda in 1961, and then left Sirunki in 1969, a
total of 14 years in New Guinea; a place where the Wagners still refer to
- as home.

The Wagners and their five daughters left New Guinea for the United
States in April of 1969.

[Title] THE WESTERN HIGHLANDS PROVINCE: The Enga People
Where is Enga Province?

Enga Province is one of the five (5) Highland Provinces in New Guinea,
which includes Eastern Highlands, Western Highlands, Chimbu, and
Southern Highlands. Enga lies towards the far north-western end of the
Highlands region in New Guinea.

Enga has five (5) District Regions:

1.Wabag Central District
2.Tsak Wapenamanda District
3.Lagaip Porgera District
4.Kompiam Ambum District
5.Kandep District

The provincial headquarter and the capital is centered in Wabag.

The Enga Province is the highest and most rugged in New Guinea. It
covers an area of 4942.2 square miles. Much of the province is at
altitudes of over 6561.7 feet. Lower altitude areas are typically valleys,
which form the watershed for the two major river systems that drain the
province, the Lagaip [which is a tributary of the Fly] and the Lai [which is
a tributary of the Wahgi] <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enga_Province>.
