William (Bill) P. Wagner, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Philip G Wagner, was
born and raised on a farm in Hudson, Colorado, (Trinity Lutheran Church
Bulletin; Greenly Colo. Febr.13, 1955)  During his earlier years, he had
no vision of becoming a pastor; that kind of life seemed too dull and
restricting.

In 1939, a farm accident marred his face and almost took his life.
Because of a farm injury he was not able to serve in the Armed Forces
during the Second World War.  However, since many mechanics had
been drafted, which had reduced the supply on the home front, he
enrolled in a national defense training course in mechanics.  From that
time onward, Bill Wagner used his mechanical abilities as a farmer with
his father and brother in Colorado, and as a missionary in New Guinea.

Later on, quite by accident, he was asked to teach Sunday School as a
substitute.  After he had taught Sunday School for a couple of years, his
pastor recognized his aptitude and encouraged him to go to Concordia
Seminary in Springfield, Illinois, which he entered in 1948 (The Lutheran
Witness. Jan 21, 1964. Triple-threat Missionary. May, Edward C.).
This was the BEGINNING of his life as a Pastor; William Wagner spent
his vicarage at St. Johns Church in West Bend, Wisconsin, and
graduated on June 4, 1954.
