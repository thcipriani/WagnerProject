The Highland Mountains were inhabited by some of the most primitive people
on earth.  Of all the mission fields in Asia, the Highlands of Papua New
Guinea were areas where Western civilization had been the last to arrive.
The terrain was mountainous, forested and, as one might not expect, highly
populated.

Initially, the missionaries faced a tremendous problem of language.  In fact,
in a single church district of 10,000, the only language spoken was Enga and
its dialects. The language had never been put into writing.
Reverend William and Mrs. Ruth Wagner were members of the Lutheran
Church - Missouri Synod.  They were first sent to do mission work with the
Enga People in Raiakama, or as Mrs. Wagner fondly calls it "The Saka."
Pidgin English was taught to a few Enga by earlier missionaries, so the
Wagners had to first learn Pidgin English in order to communicate with the
Enga people through an interpreter.
The Wagners worked in Raiakama for a total of five years (1955-1960),
during which time, Reverend Wagner added Enga to his repertoire of
languages.  In 1960, it was time for the Wagners to go home on furlough to
spend a year visiting family and friends in the United States.
During the second term, 1961-1965, Reverend Wagner was a circuit
missionary among the Yakuman people of Mambisanda,  also the chaplin for
the hospital at the Mambisanda station.  He was also asked to open the
Kopiago area in the Southern Province of New Guinea in which lived the
Duna people, later making exploratory forays into the previous uncontacted
Hewa area.  Enga and Duna interpreters accompanied the group.  The
Wagner family moved to Kopiago and in 1965 went on furlough for six (6)
months.

When they returned to New Guinea for another four (4) year stint, the
Wagners went to Sirunki (1965-1969) and remained there, doing God’s
work.  In 1969, the Wagner family decided to permanently return home to
the United States.

Besides its work in evangelism, much, much more was going on with the
mission.  Missionaries taught reading and writing, hygiene, sewing, and
introduced modern tools (Lutheran Churches of the World, pg. 208).  The
mission also built a much-needed hospital for the New Guinean people,
schools for the New Guinean and missionary children, and provided
literacy classes that taught New Guinean adults how to read and write
their own language.

Newly-built, missionary run, trade stores not only bought and sold
produce for themselves, but also introduced to the New Guinean people a
money economy and honest business practices.  In essence, the church
played a vital role in the adjustment of the Highlands to the modern
world, a responsibility it took seriously.
The Wagner’s church, The Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod, began work
in Papua New Guinea in 1948, at the invitation of a Wauni tribal leader in
Yaramanda, Enga Province.
