Ceremonial Grounds
Each clan has a meeting place where ceremonies are held.  Quite often 
near this place there is a sort of sacred grove of trees.  Women, girls 
or young boys are not allowed to go inside this grove, as this is a place 
only for men.  In this sacred grove, there is a house, usually inside or 
at the base of a tree, where the sacred stones are kept.  
The sacred stones are the link between the Enga people and deceased 
persons who are now spirits.  Each sacred stone is bathed in tree oil, 
and painted with natural or trade store color.  The Enga seek aid from 
the spirits via the stone.
