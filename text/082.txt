Trade and Commerce
While the economy is largely subsistence, wealth being connected with 
pigs, gardens, etc., there is a kind of money used.  
In the Gulf of Papua, off the southern coast of Papua new Guinea, the 
shell of a large clam is taken from the coral reefs.  This shell is cut and 
polished to reveal its golden color.  The shell is five or six inches wide.  
This shell follows a trade route and has purchase value at each stop.  
It would be difficult to determine how a shell found in the Gulf of Papua 
reaches the Enga, but it comes to them via a people in the Hagen area 
and represents a pig, which means that somewhere a man gave a pig to 
obtain the shell.  This in then used as money, one shell equalling one pig.  
The shell is accepted at face value in paying a bride price, reparations in 
the Te Ceremony, obtaining a prized Aga Nut, or Tree Oil, etc.

The Enga later made money by growing and gathering dry blossoms of 
the Pyrethrum plant, then sold them to the Australian government as a 
knock-down agent in DDT.  The Australian government and the Mission 
introduced other 'cash crops' as well.  Listen Below -
