KEEPING IN TOUCH - Communication New Guinea Style
Next
Imagine living in a lonely outpost with no near neighbors outside 
a few friendly natives.  No one to talk to over coffee, none of 
your friends around to help out in case of emergency, no 
newspaper, telephone, mailman, corner grocery, what would you 
do?

The Wagners, along with the rest of the missionaries, lived in this type of 
situation.  They often lived very far from each other -  
How did the missionaries keep in touch?  Well - they communicated 
through a receiver, a device similar to a radio. 
The receivers were powered by automobile batteries and their wavelength 
was limited to only the mission territory.  The New Guinean field had a 
system of ten receivers that were provided by a grant from the Lutheran 
Women's Mission League. 
At special times of the day, 8 a.m., noonday, and 5 p.m.,  you get 
a chance to talk while everybody listens.  It is the only opportunity 
to get the news and keep in touch with each other. Nurses 
stationed in remote territories can get in touch with a doctor for 
counsel on difficult medical problems and keep him informed on 
patients progress.  Groceries and supplies from the business office 
are ordered by transceiver - saving someone a three, or  four day 
walk.  News was also collected from the 'outside'
