Reverend Wagner worked long days in the Western Highlands of New 
Guinea and did it all on his Indian motorcyle, later replaced by two [2] 
other bikes, but the Indian was his favorite.  His work took him to the 
hydroplant, the hospital, the prison, carpentry duties, repairing the Land 
Rovers, and preparing lessons for language classes. 
Twice a week, Reverend Wagner taught at the government school, and 
also held class for missionaries who had not mastered the Enga language.   
During the mornings, he taught religion at one of the mission schools and 
also taught religion classes for the 'Doctor Boys,' who were young Enga 
men trained by a medical team to help the MDs.  The 'Doctor Boy' worked 
in a 'Haus Sik' which is a Pidgin word for clinic.  These  clinics were 
located at many of the mission stations.  
While at Mambisanda, in the afternoons, Reverend Wagner fulfilled his 
duties as the New Guinean prison chaplain at Wapenamanda, where he 
would give counsel and hold services for the inmates.  The Warden, 
prison guards, policemen, and other prison personnel would also gather 
their families to listen to Reverend Wagner's Gospel as he was also their 
pastor.  A Bible class was held for them following service.  
One evening a week, he prepared Enga policemen and their families for 
baptisms; also on another evening, missionaries and their families 
gathered for Bible study led by Reverend Wagner.
On Fridays, he instructed Enga evangelists and elders of the 
congregations in his territory.  Reverend Wagner was a very busy man.
