WHO ARE THE PEOPLE OF ENGA PROVINCE? - An Introduction 
Next
The traditional Enga settlement style is that of scattered homesteads 
dispersed throughout the landscape. Sweet potato is the staple food, 
sometimes (not often) supplemented by pork.  Pigs are a culturally valued 
item of exchange.  It is the elaborate systems of pig exchange that mark 
social life in the province.
In Enga society there is a strict segregation of sexes. Husband and wife do 
not share the same household unless the couple has tried to adopt the style 
of the Europeans.  In the true Enga culture, the women and girls live in a 
woman's house and the males and boys in a man's house.   Husbands and 
wives do not walk together; the man always peceding the wife down the 
road.  Only the wife takes care of the pigs and gardens the sweet potato.  
Her husband hunts, grows the sugarcane, builds houses, and prepares the 
mounds for his wifeâ€™s, or wives' sweet potato vines.
Who are the Enga people, you ask?  Well, the Enga are the largest linguistic 
and cultural group in all of Papua New Guinea.  They live on the western 
side of the Hagan Range in clan groups. The Enga people live mostly by 
subsistence farming. 
After getting settled in Raiakama, the Reverend William and Mrs. Wagner 
were ready to begin their work as missionaries with the Enga people of 
the Enga Province.
