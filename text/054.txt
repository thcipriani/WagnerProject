The Enga Province is the highest and most rugged in New Guinea.  It 
covers an area of 4942.2 square miles.   Much of the province is at 
altitudes of over 6561.7 feet.  Lower altitude areas are typically valleys, 
which form the watershed for the two major river systems that drain the 
province, the Lagaip [which is a tributary of the Fly] and the Lai [which is 
a tributary of the Wahgi] <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enga_Province>.
