Cont'd
The copper was a large basin which held about ten gallons of water and 
rested in the top of a 44-gallon gasoline drum.  A hole had been cut in the 
side of the drum at the bottom, and the houseboy built a fire inside to heat 
the water.  A little chimney near the top permitted the smoke to escape.  
There was no automatic washer to keep things clean and water was carried 
from such a distance that conservation was often necessary.  It required a 
good half hour to carry water from the spring in two buckets hung on a 
pole resting on the shoulders.  About thirteen buckets of water were 
needed to fill two rinsing tubs and the copper, in which the washing water 
was heated.  In addition, from four to six buckets were kept filled in the 
house for daily use.

“Sarah is now four months old and the natives are very excited 
about seeing a white child.  When she went to church for the 
first time since Christmas a few weeks ago, the reaction was 
unexpected.  Very little attention was given to the sermon, and 
when she started for home, the women and children, the men 
being more reserved and just smiling, shouted and laughed, 
reached up as if to touch her, shook their hands in front of 
themselves as we do to get our hands warm when they are 
cold, their expressions of surprise and amazement, and kept 
repeating – “Wamo! Wamo!”  [The Enga expression of surprise].  
The parade followed her to the gate to our yard and Sarah sat 
up in her daddy’s arm and just looked back at them.  Yes, it 
must be strange for them to see a father carry his tiny 
daughter, for that is something only the women do in the native 
society”
