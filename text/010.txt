The Highland Mountains were inhabited by some of the most primitive people 
on earth.  Of all the mission fields in Asia, the Highlands of Papua New 
Guinea were areas where Western civilization had been the last to arrive.  
The terrain was mountainous, forested and, as one might not expect, highly 
populated.

MISSION WORK AND THE LUTHERAN CHURCH - Missouri Synod
Initially, the missionaries faced a tremendous problem of language.  In fact, 
in a single church district of 10,000, the only language spoken was Enga and 
its dialects. The language had never been put into writing.  
Reverend William and Mrs. Ruth Wagner were members of the Lutheran 
Church - Missouri Synod.  They were first sent to do mission work with the 
Enga People in Raiakama, or as Mrs. Wagner fondly calls it "The Saka."  
Pidgin English was taught to a few Enga by earlier missionaries, so the 
Wagners had to first learn Pidgin English in order to communicate with the 
Enga people through an interpreter.  
The Wagners worked in Raiakama for a total of five years
 
[1955-1960], 
during which time, Reverend Wagner added Enga to his repertoire of 
languages.  In 1960, it was time for the Wagners to go home on furlough to 
spend a year visiting family and friends in the United States.  
During the second term, 1961-1965, Reverend Wagner was a circuit 
missionary among the Yakuman people of Mambisanda,  also the chaplin for 
the hospital at the Mambisanda station.  He was also asked to open the 
Kopiago area in the Southern Province of New Guinea in which lived the 
Duna people, later making exploratory forays into the previous uncontacted 
Hewa area.  Enga and Duna interpreters accompanied the group.  The 
Wagner family moved to Kopiago and in 1965 went on furlough for six (6) 
months.
