Highland Axes
The Uaa is the Enga and Duna word for axe.  Early axes were almost 
always wood hafted weapons, the heads of which were made of carved 
stone chipped to an edge.   As time progressed, metal-hafted and metal-
headed axes became more commonplace. Steel trade store axes have 
replaced stone axes in most of New Guinea. Stone was traditionally traded 
down from Highland quarries on both sides of the island to the rivers, 
swamps and coastal areas where any stone is scarce.  The different stones 
have names: Sambi - mottled stone; Morokea - black stone; Kunjina - 
black and grey stone [information provided by Kristen Wagner, Mrs. Ruth
