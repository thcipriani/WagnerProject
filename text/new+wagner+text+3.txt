Houses

The houses the Enga people build serve their need in the climate. The
mountains cause the nights to be cold. They build low houses with solid,
more or less windproof walls and a grass roof.

There is only one door to the house with a kyta or crash door built into the
ceiling to the rear of the house. In the event of a fire, the occupants can
break through this door and out of the house, although it is never used
except in the event of a fire.

The front door to the house is an opening in the wall, and the door is
closed by sliding doubled-over banana leaves back and forth on a pole
which is fastened over the opening. Quite often axe-hewn planks are
placed one by one across the doorway in slots made by two upright posts
to close the opening.

A fire built in the main room of the house heats the house. The smoke
finds its way out through the grass, for there is no chimney. These houses
are very warm, even hot, and the Engas are thus able to sleep warmly
without blankets. Food is cooked on the fire and there are no cooking
utensils.

Clan

The clan is concerned with its own existence, and all matters in the clan
reflect this. There are no declared chiefs or rulers in the clan. A clan
matter is usually brought up at the clan meeting place, a place where
also clan ceremonies are held. Everyone is free to speak, but of course
the opinion of the most influential member of the clan will receive support
much more so than the opinion of a “rubbish man” in the clan. So it is
the men with the most pigs, the most ground, the most wives and the
most influence who rule the clan.

The clan at one time carried on warfare with one or another of the
neighboring clans. A sort of dual code arose in this situation. You
could steal from the enemy but you could not ever steal from someone
in your clan. Outside of the clan, nothing was a felony and a particularly
successful crime might even receive the praise of the perpetrator’s
clansmen.

Marriage

In Enga society polygyny was practiced. There wasn't a limit on the
number of wives a man could have, but since there was the custom
of paying a bride price, the number of wives was naturally tied up with what
a man was able to afford.

The marriage proper was carried out in the presence of a sorcerer, or
"topori".

A feast of cooked pig, the payment of the bride price, exchange of gifts
and all having been completed, the “topori” says the proper magic
formulas to ensure a good and fruitful married life.

The taro plant, a plant with large leaves and an edible, starchy, tuberous
root figures largely in the wedding ceremony. A man and his newly
acquired bride will go to a secluded place, and there will sit on the ground
with their legs outstretched, facing each other so that the soles of his feet
touch the soles of her feet. They will then plant a taro between their
outstretched legs at the place where the soles of their feet touch.
They then live happily ever after.

As punishment for committing adultery, a husband would cut
off the front of his wife's nose. This woman covers what was
once her nose with a leaf. However, a double standard exists;
men are not punished for committing the same act.




==> text/072.txt <==

Adultery

In former days, a husband would cut off his wife’s nose or the top of her
ear or her fingers, her toes, or the back of her leg. There would often
be fights between clans because of adultery.

The wife of an adulterous man might club the woman who had
committed adultery with her husband.

A change was implemented by the Australian government around 1955.
There is not the same fear for adultery. People serve a jail sentence for
the repercussions of acts of revenge.

Enga Grief

Death and Grief

Death resides in the house as one of the family, and all are acquainted
with death. Burial of the dead is the general rule. Some, however,
depending on circumstances, were placed in holes or caves in cliffs, or
thrown into a swiftly moving river or sunk in a quagmire.

In burial the deceased is wrapped up to resemble a cocoon. His body is
then suspended between two poles and all gather around to mourn and
wail. To wail for one day is common but some will leave the body
suspended between two poles and wail for two or three days.

As an expression of grief when relative or loved one dies, one joint of a
finger was severed. There are often several deaths within a family. This
expression is practiced by men, women, and sometimes in the state of
grief, the finger joint of a child will be taken.

       "When we left Saka Raiakama [Laiagam] to go home on
         furlough, we must have shaken hands with two thousand [2000]
         people, and oh, how many had lost parts of their fingers.”
        [A note written by Mrs. Ruth Wagner]

Especially in the Highlands, the death wail is also expressed when a killing
frost either harms or kills the sweet potato vines.

Clothing

The days are warm, and therefore, there is no need for warm
clothing.

The Enga man wears no clothing to cover his body from the waist up,
and walks barefooted. He wears a belt made of string or rope, which
he has made himself. Some have acquired a leather belt to put
around his waist, with the “yabati,” an apron-like woven garment in
the front and a bunch of leaves in the rear. The little boys
approximently 12 years old and under wear nothing but a smile.

The Enga woman wears a two-section skirt or “Kuta” fastened around
her waist covering the front and the rear. The Enga girls also wear
“kuta” skirts, just like their mothers.

The "kuta" is made of reeds which are grown in a small pond much like
the cultivation of rice in Asia.  These reeds are harvested and attached
to a belt.

Gardens

The economy among the Enga people is largely a subsistence economy.
They plant gardens to supply their needs and since gardens grow all year
long, year after year, they can live off their garden.

Sweet potato, similar to the one we know, is the main food in their diet
and there are over 30 varities. Sugar cane, types of beans, taro,
a spinach-like green, and other greens are also eaten. Europeans
introduced the pumpkin, corn, peanuts, and Irish potatoes to the Enga
diet as well.

Ceremonial Grounds

Each clan has a meeting place where ceremonies are held. Quite often
near this place there is a sort of sacred grove of trees. Women, girls
or young boys are not allowed to go inside this grove, as this is a place
only for men. In this sacred grove, there is a house, usually inside or
at the base of a tree, where the sacred stones are kept.

The sacred stones are the link between the Enga people and deceased
persons who are now spirits. Each sacred stone is bathed in tree oil,
and painted with natural or trade store color. The Enga seek aid from
the spirits via the stone.

Trade and Commerce

While the economy is largely subsistence, wealth being connected with
pigs, gardens, etc., there is a kind of money used.

In the Gulf of Papua, off the southern coast of Papua new Guinea, the
shell of a large clam is taken from the coral reefs. This shell is cut and
polished to reveal its golden color. The shell is five or six inches wide.
This shell follows a trade route and has purchase value at each stop.

It would be difficult to determine how a shell found in the Gulf of Papua
reaches the Enga, but it comes to them via a people in the Hagen area
and represents a pig, which means that somewhere a man gave a pig to
obtain the shell. This in then used as money, one shell equalling one pig.
The shell is accepted at face value in paying a bride price, reparations in
the Te Ceremony, obtaining a prized Aga Nut, or Tree Oil, etc.

The Enga later made money by growing and gathering dry blossoms of
the Pyrethrum plant, then sold them to the Australian government as a
knock-down agent in DDT.   The Australian government and the Mission
introduced other 'cash crops' as well.   Listen Below -

Skills & Handicrafts

The Enga man is adept with an axe. His axe is used to chop firewood,
build a house, clear a garden and is used for self defense, sometimes war.

The Enga woman can twist the bark fibers available to her into a small
string for stringing seeds or turn it into a large string for weaving her
net bag. Bark fibers made into string produce bags used to carry
heavy loads. Fibers from the sisal plant, which was introduced from
the coast, produce a finer string for making lighter weight bags and
the men's yambati. Their skills are limited to tasks which are necessary
for them to live, making the Enga people very utilitarian.
