Mambu: 1. bamboo 2. pipe, tube 3. a flute made out of bamboo ['bamboo' 
is also called mambu in Tok Pisin]. Two main types of flutes are played in 
New Guinea: the panpipe and single-tube flute [McLean, 1994: 17-24]. 
Panpipes are widely distributed in the Highlands, but are also found in 
many other locales [McLean, 1994: 17-19]. 
This station in Yaramanda was the home of Missionary Otto Hintze, one 
of the first missionaries in the Highlands, who was in charge of this 
circuit.
Yaramanda would be the Wagner’s home for the next two months, until 
they would continue on to Saka Raiakama to begin a new main station 
and a circuit of their own.  
 
 “This little grass house (below) is in Yaramanda, that is the first, that's 
where we came to when we came into the Highlands. and a.. Yaramanda 
was or is ahh.. a Mission station that was practically the second station 
that was ... umm.. started there in the Enga territory.. Otto Hintze was 
there, that would have been 1948, 1949, when he was there…so you are 
looking out over the valley and the Lai River is there.. This is the gorge 
for the Lai River”   
“This little grass house (left) is 
called ‘Strackman’s House” 
and Bill and I lived here before 
we went to Saka Raikama.  
When we arrived in New 
Guinea, we stayed with the 
Hintze family.  This picture 
was taken at their station in 
Yaramanda. We stayed there 
with them, ate there, had our 
bible study, wonderful 
conversations, and 
on Sunday, played games. This little grass house is where we slept 
because at that time, there were no facilities for other families in theirs.  
We just slept there.  The building off to the side is one of Otto's 
'Mitianda’  (on the right) It would be where he had church service.”
