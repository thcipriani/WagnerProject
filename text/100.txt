“The most recent of the government patrols into the area established 
contacted and counted about nine hundred Hewas in four or five days of 
hiking.  We want to go into the area soon and bring the word of truth…it 
is going to be a difficult task.  Another language, more hiking and hiking 
in a different direction, not to mention the fact that there are no Hewas 
who speak Pidgin English, the language we use in making our contact.  
That means we have to use two interpreters, one to translate the Pidgin 
English we speak into the Duna Language and another to translate what 
the first interpreter has said in Duna into Hewa.  There are a few Duna 
who speak Hewa and we are told that there are a few Hewas on the 
perimeter of their area who speak Duna.  Five of the Hewa came into the 
Kopiago recently with the government patrol when it returned and they 
have now carried word of the outside world back to their people”

officers] had failed to contact more than just a handful of the Hewa.  It is 
almost unbelievable to think that in the present age of rockets, satellites, 
hydrogen and super bombs, with travel a matter of hours between 
continents that there should be a portion of this earth untouched by 
outsiders where a people live an insular life with no contact with the 
world around them.  The Hewa may as well have lived on another planet 
and may as well have watched the world go drifting by...
