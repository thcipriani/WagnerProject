BRIDGES - Connecting Roads
Imagine huge logs, about 24 to 30 inches in diameter and 65 to 70 feet 
long, being pulled by a hundred or more men.  Several of these huge logs 
are pulled to a river, ravine, or gully to make a bridge for the jeep to 
cross.  
A hole is chopped in the end of the log, much like an eye of a needle; the 
vine or root ropes are threaded through this hole and tied.  Root ropes are 
cut from a tree that grows in well-watered places.  The roots of this tree 
grow just beneath the surface of the ground and quite often are 30 to 40 
feet long.  Smaller logs or saplings are used to keep the log moving by 
being placed and replaced under the log as it is pulled along the ground.
It is usual to see 100 or more men pulling a log.  All of them make the 
occasion of pulling a log a festive one and do everything to make 
themselves more handsome and more attractive to the girls who will 
watch them.  They put feathers in their hair, paint their noses red, put 
tree oil all over their bodies, or smear charcoal on their faces.  
They chant and dance as they pull the log.  Their jumping up and down is 
timed to coordinate with the cadence of their chant, and at each jump the 
log is pulled a few inches.  Much energy is used jumping up and down, but 
it is not regarded as wasted.  If the men have to pull a number of logs and 
it becomes a bit commonplace, they put less energy into the dancing and 
more energy into the pulling.
