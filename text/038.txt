A typical Sunday for Reverend Wagner consisted of five to six church 
services for missionary personnel stationed in or around Mambisanda.  
He would then walk three or so miles to reach one of the out-station 
churches where he would conduct one or two communion services in the 
Enga tongue.  
He was also hospital chaplain, counseling elders of his congregation who 
visited Enga patients.  When missionaries, their wives, or other European 
patients were registered, he or his wife, Mrs. Ruth Wagner, visited them 
personally. 
Reverend Wagner also set aside two nights a week for study and prayer.  
This time was guarded and employed conscientiously because without 
consistent study, the rest of his program would become empty and futlle.  
Reverend Wagner worked 60 hours a week, but this was not all - 
In a culture that had never seen the wheel, a screw, or a nail, developing 
tradesmen like carpenters, electricians, or mechanics was a difficult job.  
So, Reverend Wagner worked on the complex engines in Land Rovers and 
dynamos in hydro and diesel electric plants.  He serviced and maintained 
the power plant, motorcycles, and other power equipment that kept the 
mission station at Mambisanda in working order.  
In one instance, a nurse at one of the out-stations had just radioed in 
that her motorcycle had broken down and no one could fix it.  This 
emergency was for Reverend Wagner, because tomorrow she must visit 
the sick with medicine [May, Edward C., "Triple-Threat Missionary," The 
Lutheran Witness. Jan. 21, 1964].
