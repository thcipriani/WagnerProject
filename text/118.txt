[2] Digging Stick, Cassowary Leg Bone, maker unknown
When planting sweet potatoes, the Enga woman makes small holes in the 
mound with her digging stick, and after poking the vine into it up to her 
armpit at times, packs the ground around it.  Enga men use a shorter 
version of the Cassowary Bone Digging Stick in their wigs as decoration 
during the Sing Sing.
