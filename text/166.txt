Highland Three-Pronged Tip Arrows
The lashed three-pronged tip arrow from the Western Highlands of Papua 
New Guinea or from a linguistically related people to the north in the 
Schrader or Bismarck Ranges of southern Madang Province.  This is an 
example of a hunting arrow found throughout New Guinea that is used for 
hunting birds, small tree-dwelling marsupials or, in river-let and coastal 
areas, also for fishing.  It has three lightly barbed palm wood prongs 
bound to a reed shaft.
