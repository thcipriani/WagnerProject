Bone-tipped arrows are from the Southern Highlands and have a round 
palmwood foreshaft, incised and painted red and white with a human 
bone tip.  These arrows are particularly feared, as the human bone was 
known to cause an almost certainly fatal infection if any fragment 
remained in the wound.    
THE BEGINNING - William P. Wagner  
William [Bill] P. Wagner, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Philip G Wagner, was 
born and raised on a farm in Hudson, Colorado, [Trinity Lutheran Church 
Bulletin; Greenly Colo. Febr.13, 1955]  During his earlier years, he had 
no vision of becoming a pastor; that kind of life seemed too dull and 
restricting.  
In 1939, a farm accident marred his face and almost took his life.  
Because of a farm injury he was not able to serve in the Armed Forces 
during the Second World War.  However, since many mechanics had 
been drafted, which had reduced the supply on the home front, he 
enrolled in a national defense training course in mechanics.  From that 
time onward, Bill Wagner used his mechanical abilities as a farmer with 
his father and brother in Colorado, and as a missionary in New Guinea.  
Later on, quite by accident, he was asked to teach Sunday School as a 
substitute.  After he had taught Sunday School for a couple of years, his 
pastor recognized his aptitude and encouraged him to go to Concordia 
Seminary in Springfield, Illinois, which he entered in 1948 [The Lutheran 
Witness. Jan 21, 1964. Triple-threat Missionary. May, Edward C.].  
This was the BEGINNING of his life as a Pastor; William Wagner spent 
his vicarage at St. Johns Church in West Bend, Wisconsin, and 
graduated on June 4, 1954.
