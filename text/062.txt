Family
The Enga family is a divided family.  Women, babies, all small children 
and all girls live in the women’s house.  Men and boys from five to eight 
and older all live in the men’s house. A man will build a women’s house 
near to the place where he lives in a men’s house and will have his wife 
live there, but there is a division which is hard to overcome.  
Discipline is very lax, and it is not uncommon for a young lad to sleep in 
his uncle’s house because his father wanted him to do a certain thing or 
because his father tried to correct him.  However, should a young lad 
become a discipline problem for the clan and repeatedly cause strife in 
the clan with thefts and misdemeanors, the clan will deal with him and 
sometimes deal harshly with him.

Birth
Women give birth to children in a spot removed from the house, a place 
overgrown with a considerable growth of wild can bushes and tall 
grasses.  If she has difficulty, she can cry for help, someone may come 
– it is not uncommon for a woman to have given birth to six or seven 
children and have only two reach maturity.  A child is not named at 
birth; the parents wait for a month or two to see if the child lives before 
naming him/her.
