Carved stone objects – Mortars and pestles are found buried in Highland’s 
agricultural plots.  The stone mortars are often knobbed or ridged around 
the side and rim and the pestles and pounders are often simple.  They are 
believed to be at least 3,000 years old and suggest a society of seed 
grinders, although this practice has not taken place in the region within 
living memory.  The mortars are used in magic rituals and are treated as 
objects of power [http://www.tribalarts.com/feature/highlands/index.html].
