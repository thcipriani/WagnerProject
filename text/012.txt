When they returned to New Guinea for another four [4] year stint, the 
Wagners went to Sirunki [1965-1969] and remained there, doing God’s 
work.  In 1969, the Wagner family decided to permanently return home to 
the United States. 
Besides its work in evangelism, much, much more was going on with the 
mission.  Missionaries taught reading and writing, hygiene, sewing, and 
introduced modern tools [Lutheran Churches of the World, pg. 208].  The 
mission also built a much-needed hospital for the New Guinean people, 
schools for the New Guinean and missionary children, and provided 
literacy classes that taught New Guinean adults how to read and write 
their own language. 
Newly-built, missionary run, trade stores not only bought and sold 
produce for themselves, but also introduced to the New Guinean people a 
money economy and honest business practices.  In essence, the church 
played a vital role in the adjustment of the Highlands to the modern 
world, a responsibility it took seriously. 
The Wagner’s church, The Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod, began work 
in Papua New Guinea in 1948, at the invitation of a Wauni tribal leader in 
Yaramanda, Enga Province.
