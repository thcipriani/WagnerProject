Bone-tipped arrows are from the Southern Highlands and have a round 
palmwood foreshaft, incised and painted red and white with a human 
bone tip.  These arrows are particularly feared, as the human bone was 
known to cause an almost certainly fatal infection if any fragment 
remained in the wound.    
For cooking, the Australian stove was boxed-in and filled with dirt on 
three sides, to prevent the loss of heat.  It had the firebox on top and 
oven underneath, and if there were strong winds, too much wood, they 
would quickly send the oven temperature to 450 degrees or more, 
resulting in many semi-baking failures.  During the next few years, Mrs. 
Ruth Wagner would learn to control the heat.  
The housewife in New Guinea had no store to visit to purchase her daily 
food, and until her gardens were planted and began producing, some of 
their fruits and all of their vegetables were bought from the Enga women, 
who came to the house twice a week, carrying the food in their billums.  
Since the Enga women did almost all of the gardening, it was usually they 
who came to sell, although some school boys and men also appeared.  
Enga women coming home from their gardens bear unbelievable amounts 
of food in billums on their backs often with a small child perched on top.  
The weight was so great that they were often walking bent over. 
For beads, money, or newspaper, missionary wives bought green beans, 
peas, cabbage, onions, potatoes, mapu – the white sweet potato, the 
Engas’ main item of diet, occasional yams,  kumu - the native spinach, 
pumpkin greens, corn, several varieties of bananas, papaya, tomatoes, 
and chicken eggs to supplement their diet (WNL).
