Reverend Wagner was then called to be Pastor at Grace Lutheran Church in 
Liberal, Kansas, and Mrs. Wagner taught at West Middle School for fifteen 
[15] years.  She retired from teaching in 1992, but that did not last long - 
she was a substitute teacher there as well, later working as a sales 
associate in a high-end boutique store.  She left Liberal in 1995, and moved 
to Wichita Kansas, where she again substituted, later taking a teaching 
position at Bethany Lutheran Church and School until retiring again in 2005.   
Mrs. Ruth Wagner is actively retired and involved with church, friends, and 
family.  
In 2005 and 2006, Mrs. Ruth Wagner donated collections of New Guinean 
artifacts to the Lowell D. Holmes Museum of Anthropology, located on the 
Wichita State University campus.  Many of the artifacts were gifts that had 
been presented to Reverend Wagner by the Enga, Duna, and Hewa 
clansmen during his time in New Guinea.  
As an educator, the imparting of knowledge is very important to Mrs. 
Wagner.  This attribute is an integral part of the mission of the Lowell D. 
Holmes Museum of Anthropology.  Although the museum is a teaching 
facility where students learn how to become museum professionals, it also 
provides an opportunity for visitors to become immersed in different 
cultures, thus learning more about the world around them.  
The donation of the collections will enable students, scholars, and the public 
alike to gain insight into the Wagners' life and vocation.  They will also learn 
about Papua New Guinea and about the Western and Southern Highland 
peoples who inhabit that region.
