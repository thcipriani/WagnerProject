Death and Grief
Death resides in the house as one of the family, and all are acquainted 
with death.  Burial of the dead is the general rule. Some, however, 
depending on circumstances, were placed in holes or caves in cliffs, or 
thrown into a swiftly moving river or sunk in a quagmire.  
In burial the deceased is wrapped up to resemble a cocoon.  His body is 
then suspended between two poles and all gather around to mourn and 
wail.  To wail for one day is common but some will leave the body 
suspended between two poles and wail for two or three days.  
As an expression of grief when relative or loved one dies, one joint of a 
finger was severed.  There are often several deaths within a family.  This 
expression is practiced by men, women, and sometimes in the state of 
grief, the finger joint of a child will be taken.

furlough, we must have shaken hands with two thousand [2000] 
people, and oh, how many had lost parts of their fingers.‚Äù

Especially in the Highlands, the death wail is also expressed when a killing 
frost either harms or kills the sweet potato vines.
