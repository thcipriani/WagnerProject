Bone-tipped arrows are from the Southern Highlands and have a round 
palmwood foreshaft, incised and painted red and white with a human 
bone tip.  These arrows are particularly feared, as the human bone was 
known to cause an almost certainly fatal infection if any fragment 
remained in the wound.
