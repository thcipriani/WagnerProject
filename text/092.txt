The Duna
The Duna Wigmen are proud warriors and have great reverence for birds, 
imitating them in ceremonial dances and decorating their wigs with 
feathers, flowers and cuscus fur.  Their wigs, like the Enga people, are 
woven from human hair, donated by their wives and children.  
Strawflowers are especially cultivated for use in their wigs, which is where 
the similarity with the Enga stops.  The Duna men also wear wig-rings 
made out of seeds that hang from their wigs, and not their ears.  A jingle 
can be heard with each step a Duna man takes.
