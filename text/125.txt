“I have only one image of the New Guinean Jew’s harp made from 
bamboo: it is when my father took me with him to Pausa [area in 
the Highlands], for the 25th Anniversary of the missionary work in 
New Guinea.  My recollection is faint, but I have a vision of a New 
Guinean man dressed in his native dress holding the Jew’s harp up 
to his lips with one hand, and with the other hand moving the string.  
The sound that was produced, as I dimly remember, was that of 
musical twangs.”
