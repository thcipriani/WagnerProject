The Enga man is adept with an axe. His axe is used to chop firewood, 
build a house, clear a garden and is used for self defense, sometimes

The Enga woman can twist the bark fibers available to her into a small 
string for stringing seeds or turn it into a large string for weaving her 
net bag.  Bark fibers made into string produce bags used to carry 
heavy loads.  Fibers from the sisal plant, which was introduced from 
the coast, produce a finer string for making lighter weight bags and 
the men's yambati.  Their skills are limited to tasks which are 
necessary for them to live, making the Enga people very utilitarian.
