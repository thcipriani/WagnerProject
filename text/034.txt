Many people asked how the Wagners celebrated Christmas in the 
Highlands.  Native teachers and evangelists in their circuit along with their 
families came to the station for a Christmas party.  After a simple church 
service in the Mission’s teacher’s house, which included the sermon and 
Christmas carols sung in Pidgin English, the group retired to another room 
with a fire burning in the center for warmth and light. 
CHRISTMAS - Away From Home
“Here we played “Button, button, who’s got the button?” with a 
small potato and the natives literally rolled on the floor with 
laughter.  This game they have never played before.  The food 
served was quite strange to them and included whole wheat 
bread sandwiches of fish and cheese, oatmeal cookies and candy.  
Even the bread, they said, was sweet.  When they first tasted the 
food they held it gingerly and took very little bites, but all of it 
was eaten except the cookies.  They were too sweet.  Later, gifts 
were distributed for the Mission Cheer Committee to each 
family”.

Celebrating the family Christmas at home in their ‘Bush’ house, Mrs. Ruth 
Wagner states:
“In our little home there was a simple Christmas tree on the table 
made of branches of the Napi tree on which were hung tiny 
ornaments and tinsel sent by friends in the States.  With a piece 
of a white sheet underneath around the tin can in which the tree 
rested, with boxes from home waiting to be opened, with Sarah 
[Reverend William and Ruth’s first daughter] in her bassinet and 
the story of the birth of Jesus still sounding in our hearts we had 
a lovely, simple Christmas eve”.
