Bone-tipped arrows are from the Southern Highlands and have a round 
palmwood foreshaft, incised and painted red and white with a human 
bone tip.  These arrows are particularly feared, as the human bone was 
known to cause an almost certainly fatal infection if any fragment 
remained in the wound.    
ENGA CONCEPTS: Overview
[Excerpt from Wagner Newsletter, Sept 24, 1963].
The Enga concepts of life and the world are practical, earthly concepts.  
They accept the world, the sun, the moon and the stars as something that 
is.  Their concept of a higher power is embodied in the “semongo", or the 
spirits of the deceased in their family, in their tribe or among their 
kinsmen.  These spirits frequent the places where the deceased lived their 
earthly lives, and can cause illness, death, poor crops, etc..
Their fables, which they tell and retell, deal with matters like planting 
gardens, gathering of produce from the garden, cooking food, eating food, 
or marrying, to name a few.  Another type of spirit enters into these fables; 
he is called “putututi” or “kanamongari”.  He can change his form and 
become human, an animal, an insect, a bird, or even a tree.  The Enga fear 
“putututi” as much as they fear “semongo", as they are both powerful 
spirits.
