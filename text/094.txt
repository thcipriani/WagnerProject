Reverend Wagner, studying the Duna language, was in anticipation of 
working with the Duna people, hoping that the Kapyokoo area would be 
open to missionaries by July 1963.  This did not happen.  
Later in the year, he had gone to a Wabag Lutheran Church [W.L.C.] 
conference, which was a body of over 26,000 communicant members who 
sent out evangelists and teachers to new areas in New Guinea.  They had

approved the sending of twenty men into the Kapyokoo area 
[where the Duna live]..., as soon as it is opened

Reverend Wagner continued,
 
Just recently we were fortunate to be able to find a Duna 
speaker to help us prepare for the work in the Kapyokoo area 
[Kapyokoo is the Enga word for Kopiago area]… he is able to 
speak three languages: Duna, Ipi, and Enga…. However we 
found out that his Duna is limited.  We are now working 
among the Enga people and are separated from the Duna by 
people who speak Ipi… from Enga to Duna it is five days walk 
over some very mountainous and timbered country. For 
several days the path leads through the Ipi country where 
some people make gardens and live. 
 
The last several days of the journey is through timbered 
uninhabited country.  Recently, too, we hear “rumors” that 
the Kapyokoo area will not be opened until 1964
