The facts were that one teenage daughter was already 3,000 miles away 
attending one of the secondary schools in Australia and another daughter 
would be going there in two years to also further her education.  The 
Wagners realized that this was a difficult task for any child to endure. One 
of their daughters was living most of the time away from home and 
another would follow.  As parents, Reverend and Mrs. Ruth Wagner 
understood the isolation their daughter felt and they did not want to 
continue being separated from her or their other daughters for most of the 
time.

Our first Christmas there and how it had meant so much to us because 
Sarah, our first born, had arrived one month earlier.  But now, Sarah 
would be returning home from Luther College in Melbourne [Australia] 
to New Guinea for the family’s last Christmas together before going to 
America.  [Wagner Newsletter.  1968]
Although their future [at that time] was quite indefinite, the Wagners had 
found a new peace in their decision.  Reverend Wagner made inquiries 
about studying again before accepting a call into the parish ministry.  In 
the meantime, the Wagners would follow God’s guiding hand.  It had been 
arranged that another Pastor and his wife would replace them at their last 
mission station in Sirunki.  In all, the Wagners were in New Guinea from 
1955 at Raiakama, moved to Mambisanda in 1961, and then left Sirunki in 
1969, a total of 14 years in New Guinea; a place where the Wagners still 
refer to - as home. 
In the decision to leave for the USA, Mrs. Ruth Wagner looks back to the 
joy of her first memories of being in New Guinea - 
The Wagners and their five daughters left New Guinea for the United 
States in April of 1969.
