Shields: Warfare is a major aspect of Highland’s life, and shields are the 
supreme artistic expression connected with it.  Highland’s shields are 
used exclusively for combat and are not related to ceremonial 
occasions, as they are in other parts of Melanesia.  During periods of 
peace, they were usually stored in their owner’s abode above the fire or 
in the Men’s House.  The smoke of the fire blackened and hardened the 
timber, so that shields often lasted a century.  Periods of peace were 
always unstable, due to ever-changing alliances.  When warfare 
inevitable erupted, these stored shields were brought down, repainted, 
and used.     
Under the Australian colonial rule policy of “Pacification,” which was 
initiated in the Highlands from first contact in the 1930s through 
Independence in 1975, large scale inter-tribal warfare all but ceased.  
Even the smaller skirmishes were largely contained.  Many shields and 
other weapons were burned or discarded during this period, but during 
the late 1970s, both warfare and shield production began to revive.  
Highland’s shields were traditionally stone-adzed, but the introduction 
of steel blades has resulted in little alteration in shape, size, or design
