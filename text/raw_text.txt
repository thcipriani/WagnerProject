FORWARD - What is this website about?
In this web site are words.   They are the words of Mrs. Ruth Wagner who 
describes the fourteen years [1955 to 1969] she and her husband, 
Reverend William P. Wagner, spent as a missionary team in the highlands 
of New Guinea.  In 1955, William P. Wagner [Bill for short], a 34-year old 
Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Springfield, Illinois, seminary graduate, 
and his bride, Ruth, a former public school teacher in Toledo, Ohio, 
willingly left the United States to set foot in a new land.  Only nine other 
missionaries had been there before them.
As she relates her story, Mrs. Ruth Wagner shares her memories, 
thoughts, feelings; many photographs, films, conference papers, and 
mission newsletters describing their encounters with the Enga, Hewa, and 
Duna people of New Guinea.  As much as I have tried to put her story 
into a respectable format, so that she could share this knowledge with 
the world, I am fully aware that I cannot possibly capture all the verve 
and excitement this journey created.  However, I hope I did it justice.  
To fully enjoy this web book, photos and maps can expand and return to 
normal size by simply "clicking" on them.  The film and audio clips 
complement the Wagner story, and are accessed in the same manner.  
The conference papers, mission newsletters, photos, and films used to 
create this website were all donated by Mrs. Ruth Wagner, unless cited 
otherwise.  The complete collection is available for viewing on DVD media 
at the Neff Hall Anthropology Library, the Lowell D. Holmes Museum of 
Anthropology in Neff Hall on the Wichita State University Campus, or at 
the Wichita State University Library in the Special Collections department.
Enjoy!

The Highland Mountains were inhabited by some of the most primitive people 
on earth.  Of all the mission fields in Asia, the Highlands of Papua New 
Guinea were areas where Western civilization had been the last to arrive.  
The terrain was mountainous, forested and, as one might not expect, highly 
populated.

MISSION WORK AND THE LUTHERAN CHURCH - Missouri Synod
Initially, the missionaries faced a tremendous problem of language.  In fact, 
in a single church district of 10,000, the only language spoken was Enga and 
its dialects. The language had never been put into writing.  
Reverend William and Mrs. Ruth Wagner were members of the Lutheran 
Church - Missouri Synod.  They were first sent to do mission work with the 
Enga People in Raiakama, or as Mrs. Wagner fondly calls it "The Saka."  
Pidgin English was taught to a few Enga by earlier missionaries, so the 
Wagners had to first learn Pidgin English in order to communicate with the 
Enga people through an interpreter.  
The Wagners worked in Raiakama for a total of five years
 
[1955-1960], 
during which time, Reverend Wagner added Enga to his repertoire of 
languages.  In 1960, it was time for the Wagners to go home on furlough to 
spend a year visiting family and friends in the United States.  
During the second term, 1961-1965, Reverend Wagner was a circuit 
missionary among the Yakuman people of Mambisanda,  also the chaplin for 
the hospital at the Mambisanda station.  He was also asked to open the 
Kopiago area in the Southern Province of New Guinea in which lived the 
Duna people, later making exploratory forays into the previous uncontacted 
Hewa area.  Enga and Duna interpreters accompanied the group.  The 
Wagner family moved to Kopiago and in 1965 went on furlough for six (6) 
months.

When they returned to New Guinea for another four [4] year stint, the 
Wagners went to Sirunki [1965-1969] and remained there, doing God’s 
work.  In 1969, the Wagner family decided to permanently return home to 
the United States. 
Besides its work in evangelism, much, much more was going on with the 
mission.  Missionaries taught reading and writing, hygiene, sewing, and 
introduced modern tools [Lutheran Churches of the World, pg. 208].  The 
mission also built a much-needed hospital for the New Guinean people, 
schools for the New Guinean and missionary children, and provided 
literacy classes that taught New Guinean adults how to read and write 
their own language. 
Newly-built, missionary run, trade stores not only bought and sold 
produce for themselves, but also introduced to the New Guinean people a 
money economy and honest business practices.  In essence, the church 
played a vital role in the adjustment of the Highlands to the modern 
world, a responsibility it took seriously. 
The Wagner’s church, The Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod, began work 
in Papua New Guinea in 1948, at the invitation of a Wauni tribal leader in 
Yaramanda, Enga Province.

THE BEGINNING - William P. Wagner  
William [Bill] P. Wagner, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Philip G Wagner, was 
born and raised on a farm in Hudson, Colorado, [Trinity Lutheran Church 
Bulletin; Greenly Colo. Febr.13, 1955]  During his earlier years, he had 
no vision of becoming a pastor; that kind of life seemed too dull and 
restricting.  
In 1939, a farm accident marred his face and almost took his life.  
Because of a farm injury he was not able to serve in the Armed Forces 
during the Second World War.  However, since many mechanics had 
been drafted, which had reduced the supply on the home front, he 
enrolled in a national defense training course in mechanics.  From that 
time onward, Bill Wagner used his mechanical abilities as a farmer with 
his father and brother in Colorado, and as a missionary in New Guinea.  
Later on, quite by accident, he was asked to teach Sunday School as a 
substitute.  After he had taught Sunday School for a couple of years, his 
pastor recognized his aptitude and encouraged him to go to Concordia 
Seminary in Springfield, Illinois, which he entered in 1948 [The Lutheran 
Witness. Jan 21, 1964. Triple-threat Missionary. May, Edward C.].  
This was the BEGINNING of his life as a Pastor; William Wagner spent 
his vicarage at St. Johns Church in West Bend, Wisconsin, and 
graduated on June 4, 1954.

MARRIAGE PROPOSAL - Then Off to New Guinea!
Two months later, William Wagner proposed marriage to Ohioan Ruth L. 
Prueter and they were married on August 14, 1954 in Memorial Lutheran 
Church in Toledo, Ohio.  Ruth, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Henry W. 
Prueter, was born and raised in Toledo, Ohio.  She attended the University 
of Toledo, graduating in June 1948, with a Bachelor of Education degree.  
Afterwards, she taught in the Toledo public schools for six years.    
In preparation for their work in the mission field in New Guinea, both Mr. 
and Mrs. William Wagner attended the Mission School at Concordia 
Seminary, in Saint Louis, from September, 1954 to January, 1955.  
William Wagner and his bride, Mrs. Ruth Wagner then returned to 
Greeley, Colorado, where William [Bill] Wagner was ordained and 
commissioned as a missionary to New Guinea at 3 p.m., February 13, 
1955.  [The Lutheran Witness; St. Louis MO., March15, 1955]
Reverend and Mrs. William P. Wagner then left for San Francisco, 
California where they boarded a plane for Madang [The Lutheran Witness; 
St. Louis MO., March15, 1955].   
Their final destination was the Western Highlands of Papua, New Guinea 
where they were to work with the Enga, and later make exploratory trips 
into the Hewa territories.

In March 1955, Reverend William and Ruth Wagner's plane touched down in 
New Guinea.  Reverend Wagner writes: 
STARTING A NEW LIFE TOGETHER – Arriving in Papua, New Guinea
Next
Their first stop was the station at Yaramanda, the home of pioneer 
Missionary Otto Hintze, one of the first missionaries in the Highlands 
[arrival in 1948], who was in charge of this circuit. This would be the 
Wagner's home for the next two months, until they would continue on to 
Saka Raiakama to begin a new main station and circuit of their own.  
"As our plane circled over Yaramanda, we could see people running 
out of houses and looking up at us.  The plane continued on a short 
distance; we looked back and saw the crowd dissolve into a line and 
the far end of the line start toward the air-strip.  The crowd came 
streaming down the hill as the plane came over the strip and 
dropped down to land.  The Cessna taxied to a stop and the moment 
the propeller stopped turning the plane was surrounded by a 
hundred or more natives.  Everyone wanted to shake hands with us 
and welcome us to Yaramanda.  To whooping and the chanting, we 
climbed the long hill to the station.  We had arrived in New Guinea."

Bush houses, like the one Reverend William and Mrs. Ruth Wagner lived 
in when they arrived in Yaramanda and also similar to their living quarters 
in Saka Raiakama, were built mostly of saplings, trees, and grass, with 
sawn lumber only used for doors and door frames, window frames, and 
window sills.  
BUSH HOUSES - How they are built
These houses were only temporary accommodations for the missionaries, 
although they lived in them for years.  The Bush houses would eventually 
be replaced by permanent frame-houses built by mission carpenters.  
The Wagners would finally receive their permanent house in May of 
1958, and it had some modern conveniences, including piped-in water 
for the kitchen and bath.  This water came from a large metal tank 
designed to catch rain water.

The Lutherans in New Guinea
German missionaries of the Neuendettelsau and Rhenish missions 
began the work in 1886, entering at two points on the north coast of 
what was then the new German colony of East New Guinea. The 
inhabitants, Melanesians and Papuans by race, were considered 
primitive.  Today in unexplored pockets in the inland mountains, there 
still live some of the most primitive people on earth; of all the mission 
fields of Asia this is the one where Western civilization has been the 
last to come.  The land is mountainous, forested and as might be 
expected, thinly populated.  The missionaries faced a tremendous 
problem of language.  In 1957, the half a million people populating 
the area of the Lutheran church were divided into sixty or eighty 
tribes and spoke as many different tongues.  During that time, in a 
single church district of 8,000 people four languages are used.  None 
of these languages had ever been put into writing.  The missionaries 
chose three of the principal languages as “church languages” and 
used them and interpreters for their work, adding “pidgin” which is an 
adaptation of English.   
The story of the development leading up to the remarkable 
organization that is the Lutheran Mission New Guinea has a dramatic 
history of missionary vision and loyalty, of the bond of faith bringing 
aid in the emergencies caused by two world wars, and of the final 
union in 1953 of German (Neuendettelsau), Australian (UELCA),  and 
the American (ALC, which replaced the Rhenish Mission) missions into 
a single internationally staffed and financed (with substantial 
subsidies from the LWF) organization.  It was equipped as never 
before to carry on in times that was critical for the development of 
the New Guinean people and for the church.

There were two rooms in the Bush house, each 15’ x 15’, of which one 
was their bedroom.  This room was also a semi-storage room and 
contained a shower.  The shower was a converted milking bucket with a 
hose attached underneath, resembling a sprinkler can, and manipulated 
up and down by means of a rope and pulley.  Water was heated on the 
stove and brought to the bathroom.
The other room, a kitchen, contained a food-safe for the storage of food, 
which was partly enclosed by a screen. There was a cabinet similar to a 
buffet with two drawers on top and two large doors with shelves inside, a 
6’ x 42” table which could easily accomodate ten people, four chairs, the 
wood stove and firewood box, a counter and shelves along one side, a 
shelf for holding the water buckets, plus odds-and-ends in corners and 
various articles hanging on the walls.  
The ceiling in the house had large strips of waterproof tar paper nailed to 
saplings, with the paper extending from one end of the house to the 
other.  This ceiling afforded a catch-all for fragments from the saplings 
above dropping onto the table, food, bed, etc.  The walls were two [2] 
layers of blind with kunai grass in between as insulation in which small 
rats scurried up and down and also under the Wagners' bed.  Mouse traps 
were not strong enough to catch these rats.  Reverend William Wagner 
used a hammer at night; he learned to be quick getting out of bed.   Rats 
were frequent visitors in all bush houses, and cats were also very helpful 
to keep down their population [Wagner Oral Slide History].

MRS. RUTH WAGNER - A Missionary Wife’s Life
The Enga women watched curiously and intently when Ruth hung out her 
wash.  The Enga women did not wash clothes because there were no 
clothes to wash; a woman's attire was limited to a reed or “kuta” skirt.  
But the Enga women, who ardently watched the missionary’s wife, 
gradually learned that they could go to her in times of trouble or sickness.  
The brown and white women learned to communicate, at first without 
words, later through an interpreter, and still later in literacy classes in the 
vernacular, which Ruth Wagner conducted [Conference Paper: "The Enga 
Woman"].   Ruth also gave medical attention to the Enga, and introduced 
the Lamaze Technique of childbirth to European mothers-to-be; this 
technique was developed in the 1940s. 
Next
In daily living, the duties were much the same as those of a housewife 
in the United States, except that the equipment she worked with was 
quite different.  The washing machine was a tall, cylindrical tub on legs 
with a large plunger actuated by a lever arrangement.  Two Enga 
Christian boys took turns to pump up and down. The hand wringer was 
moved back-and-forth from the machine to a supporting board in-
between the two rinsing tubs used for wringing the clothes. 
The ironing was done with a Coleman gas iron with a little tank attached 
to the rear, which is filled with gasoline for each ironing job, pumped 
with air, primed at the bottom and then ignited.

For cooking, the Australian stove was boxed-in and filled with dirt on 
three sides, to prevent the loss of heat.  It had the firebox on top and 
oven underneath, and if there were strong winds, too much wood, they 
would quickly send the oven temperature to 450 degrees or more, 
resulting in many semi-baking failures.  During the next few years, Mrs. 
Ruth Wagner would learn to control the heat.  
The housewife in New Guinea had no store to visit to purchase her daily 
food, and until her gardens were planted and began producing, some of 
their fruits and all of their vegetables were bought from the Enga women, 
who came to the house twice a week, carrying the food in their billums.  
Since the Enga women did almost all of the gardening, it was usually they 
who came to sell, although some school boys and men also appeared.  
Enga women coming home from their gardens bear unbelievable amounts 
of food in billums on their backs often with a small child perched on top.  
The weight was so great that they were often walking bent over. 
For beads, money, or newspaper, missionary wives bought green beans, 
peas, cabbage, onions, potatoes, mapu – the white sweet potato, the 
Engas’ main item of diet, occasional yams,  kumu - the native spinach, 
pumpkin greens, corn, several varieties of bananas, papaya, tomatoes, 
and chicken eggs to supplement their diet (WNL).

Sarah, shown with her mother, Ruth, was born at Jagaum Lutheran 
Hospital near Madang – which is on the New Guinean coast.  Mrs. Ruth 
Wagner went there because the hospital in their mission circuit was still 
under construction.  Ruth and baby Sarah flew back from the coastal 
hospital to the government airstrip and station at Wapenamada, where 
they took the mission Landrover to Mambisanda and waited for Reverend 
Wagner to arrive.  They then would head back to their home at Raiakama, 
in the Saka Valley.
RAISING A FAMILY – In New Guinea

“Bill saw Sarah for the first time that same morning they left for 
Saka Laiagam, with Reverend Bill walking and Ruth in a chair 
carried by Engas as she was not allowed to climb up and down 
cliff sides and valleys.  Sarah wrapped in blankets and lying on a 
“turi” in her “bilum”, traveling Enga fashion on the back of our 
houseboy” [Wagner Newsletter, Dec 1955].  
Sarah is the Reverend and Mrs. Wagner’s first child; she was born in New 
Guinea.  Throughout the couple’s fourteen years with the Enga, Duna, 
and Hewa people, the Wagners had five beautiful daughters; Sarah, 
Jennifer, Stephanie, Lisa, and Kristen; all were born in New Guinea. 
Being a new mother was always a learning experience, but caring for a 
new baby in New Guinea with just the barest of essentials needed to care 
for her was difficult, and had, of course, changed the couple’s daily 
routine.   Washing was now done at least three times a week, two baby 
washes were boiled in the copper outside, and one washed with the 
regular wash.

The copper was a large basin which held about ten gallons of water and 
rested in the top of a 44-gallon gasoline drum.  A hole had been cut in the 
side of the drum at the bottom, and the houseboy built a fire inside to heat 
the water.  A little chimney near the top permitted the smoke to escape.  
There was no automatic washer to keep things clean and water was carried 
from such a distance that conservation was often necessary.  It required a 
good half hour to carry water from the spring in two buckets hung on a 
pole resting on the shoulders.  About thirteen buckets of water were 
needed to fill two rinsing tubs and the copper, in which the washing water 
was heated.  In addition, from four to six buckets were kept filled in the 
house for daily use.   
Next
“Sarah is now four months old and the natives are very excited 
about seeing a white child.  When she went to church for the 
first time since Christmas a few weeks ago, the reaction was 
unexpected.  Very little attention was given to the sermon, and 
when she started for home, the women and children, the men 
being more reserved and just smiling, shouted and laughed, 
reached up as if to touch her, shook their hands in front of 
themselves as we do to get our hands warm when they are 
cold, their expressions of surprise and amazement, and kept 
repeating – “Wamo! Wamo!”  [The Enga expression of surprise].  
The parade followed her to the gate to our yard and Sarah sat 
up in her daddy’s arm and just looked back at them.  Yes, it 
must be strange for them to see a father carry his tiny 
daughter, for that is something only the women do in the native 
society”

Highlands.  Native teachers and evangelists in their circuit along with their 
families came to the station for a Christmas party.  After a simple church 
service in the Mission’s teacher’s house, which included the sermon and 
Christmas carols sung in Pidgin English, the group retired to another room 
with a fire burning in the center for warmth and light. 
CHRISTMAS - Away From Home
“Here we played “Button, button, who’s got the button?” with a 
small potato and the natives literally rolled on the floor with 
laughter.  This game they have never played before.  The food 
served was quite strange to them and included whole wheat 
bread sandwiches of fish and cheese, oatmeal cookies and candy.  
Even the bread, they said, was sweet.  When they first tasted the 
food they held it gingerly and took very little bites, but all of it 
was eaten except the cookies.  They were too sweet.  Later, gifts 
were distributed for the Mission Cheer Committee to each 
family”. 
 [Wagner Newsletter, March 1955]

Celebrating the family Christmas at home in their ‘Bush’ house, Mrs. Ruth 
Wagner states:
“In our little home there was a simple Christmas tree on the table 
made of branches of the Napi tree on which were hung tiny 
ornaments and tinsel sent by friends in the States.  With a piece 
of a white sheet underneath around the tin can in which the tree 
rested, with boxes from home waiting to be opened, with Sarah 
[Reverend William and Ruth’s first daughter] in her bassinet and 
the story of the birth of Jesus still sounding in our hearts we had 
a lovely, simple Christmas eve”.

Reverend Wagner worked long days in the Western Highlands of New 
Guinea and did it all on his Indian motorcyle, later replaced by two [2] 
other bikes, but the Indian was his favorite.  His work took him to the 
hydroplant, the hospital, the prison, carpentry duties, repairing the Land 
Rovers, and preparing lessons for language classes. 
Twice a week, Reverend Wagner taught at the government school, and 
also held class for missionaries who had not mastered the Enga language.   
During the mornings, he taught religion at one of the mission schools and 
also taught religion classes for the 'Doctor Boys,' who were young Enga 
men trained by a medical team to help the MDs.  The 'Doctor Boy' worked 
in a 'Haus Sik' which is a Pidgin word for clinic.  These  clinics were 
located at many of the mission stations.  
While at Mambisanda, in the afternoons, Reverend Wagner fulfilled his 
duties as the New Guinean prison chaplain at Wapenamanda, where he 
would give counsel and hold services for the inmates.  The Warden, 
prison guards, policemen, and other prison personnel would also gather 
their families to listen to Reverend Wagner's Gospel as he was also their 
pastor.  A Bible class was held for them following service.  
One evening a week, he prepared Enga policemen and their families for 
baptisms; also on another evening, missionaries and their families 
gathered for Bible study led by Reverend Wagner.
On Fridays, he instructed Enga evangelists and elders of the 
congregations in his territory.  Reverend Wagner was a very busy man.

A typical Sunday for Reverend Wagner consisted of five to six church 
services for missionary personnel stationed in or around Mambisanda.  
He would then walk three or so miles to reach one of the out-station 
churches where he would conduct one or two communion services in the 
Enga tongue.  
He was also hospital chaplain, counseling elders of his congregation who 
visited Enga patients.  When missionaries, their wives, or other European 
patients were registered, he or his wife, Mrs. Ruth Wagner, visited them 
personally. 
Reverend Wagner also set aside two nights a week for study and prayer.  
This time was guarded and employed conscientiously because without 
consistent study, the rest of his program would become empty and futlle.  
Reverend Wagner worked 60 hours a week, but this was not all - 
In a culture that had never seen the wheel, a screw, or a nail, developing 
tradesmen like carpenters, electricians, or mechanics was a difficult job.  
So, Reverend Wagner worked on the complex engines in Land Rovers and 
dynamos in hydro and diesel electric plants.  He serviced and maintained 
the power plant, motorcycles, and other power equipment that kept the 
mission station at Mambisanda in working order.  
In one instance, a nurse at one of the out-stations had just radioed in 
that her motorcycle had broken down and no one could fix it.  This 
emergency was for Reverend Wagner, because tomorrow she must visit 
the sick with medicine [May, Edward C., "Triple-Threat Missionary," The 
Lutheran Witness. Jan. 21, 1964].

KEEPING IN TOUCH - Communication New Guinea Style
Next
Imagine living in a lonely outpost with no near neighbors outside 
a few friendly natives.  No one to talk to over coffee, none of 
your friends around to help out in case of emergency, no 
newspaper, telephone, mailman, corner grocery, what would you 
do?
 [Dicke, Ed. Mission Accessories].
The Wagners, along with the rest of the missionaries, lived in this type of 
situation.  They often lived very far from each other -  
How did the missionaries keep in touch?  Well - they communicated 
through a receiver, a device similar to a radio. 
The receivers were powered by automobile batteries and their wavelength 
was limited to only the mission territory.  The New Guinean field had a 
system of ten receivers that were provided by a grant from the Lutheran 
Women's Mission League. 
At special times of the day, 8 a.m., noonday, and 5 p.m.,  you get 
a chance to talk while everybody listens.  It is the only opportunity 
to get the news and keep in touch with each other. Nurses 
stationed in remote territories can get in touch with a doctor for 
counsel on difficult medical problems and keep him informed on 
patients progress.  Groceries and supplies from the business office 
are ordered by transceiver - saving someone a three, or  four day 
walk.  News was also collected from the 'outside'

Traveling in New Guinea – The making of Roads
Until 1954, traffic problems were nonexistent; there were no roads or 
bridges.  If anyone wanted to go anywhere, he walked – not over nice, 
graveled paths, but up and down grassy clay trails which also served as 
gutters to drain the rains off the mountains.  Later on, the first traffic 
“problem” developed.  The local Australian government officer purchased a 
Land Rover [a British Jeep] and then the mission received as a gift, a Land 
Rover as well, considering the possibility, however remote, that these two 
Land Rovers might meet head on at a sharp bend in the only (singular) 
mountain road, something had to be done.  By 1956, there were over 
some 120 miles of road in the Wabag and Laiagam sub districts.    
Roads were carved out of the mountains with pick, shovel, and the force of 
numbers, as this was the only means at hand to build roads. And even 
though more and more roads were being built by the Enga and Duna 
people, transportation in the immediate area where the Wagner’s lived, 
was very limited.  The missionaries did a great deal of walking and the 
Enga carried supplies, lumber, etc., on their backs.  
The mission territory on the whole, owned eight four-wheel drive jeeps 
and a truck.  Each mission station may have had one jeep, but the mission 
also had twenty-one [21] motorcycles which everyone traveled by.  
The carpenters went  to work on motorcycles; the teachers visited their 
schools on motorcycles.  The evangelistic missionaries reached as many 
out-stations as possible by motorcycle, each as far as the road could take 
them, and then it was by foot again.  To connect roads and to cross rivers, 
bridges had to be put in place.

BRIDGES - Connecting Roads
Imagine huge logs, about 24 to 30 inches in diameter and 65 to 70 feet 
long, being pulled by a hundred or more men.  Several of these huge logs 
are pulled to a river, ravine, or gully to make a bridge for the jeep to 
cross.  
A hole is chopped in the end of the log, much like an eye of a needle; the 
vine or root ropes are threaded through this hole and tied.  Root ropes are 
cut from a tree that grows in well-watered places.  The roots of this tree 
grow just beneath the surface of the ground and quite often are 30 to 40 
feet long.  Smaller logs or saplings are used to keep the log moving by 
being placed and replaced under the log as it is pulled along the ground.
It is usual to see 100 or more men pulling a log.  All of them make the 
occasion of pulling a log a festive one and do everything to make 
themselves more handsome and more attractive to the girls who will 
watch them.  They put feathers in their hair, paint their noses red, put 
tree oil all over their bodies, or smear charcoal on their faces.  
They chant and dance as they pull the log.  Their jumping up and down is 
timed to coordinate with the cadence of their chant, and at each jump the 
log is pulled a few inches.  Much energy is used jumping up and down, but 
it is not regarded as wasted.  If the men have to pull a number of logs and 
it becomes a bit commonplace, they put less energy into the dancing and 
more energy into the pulling.

Reverend Wagner's 'Walkabout'

A NEW GUINEAN “WALKABOUT”
To a New Guinean missionary -  
Next
Consider this incident of a descent and add a few more ascents 
and descents to it, to visualize a one-day journey.  We were above 
Makare, and the altimeter read 8,000 feet.  At Makare, forty-five 
minutes later, of which the last ten minutes were more or less 
level going, the altimeter read 6,600 feet – a drop of 1,400 feet in 
a little more than half an hour  
[Wagner Newsletter, pg 3, May 9, 
1955].
The first “Walkabout” the Reverend Bill Wagner took was when he and 
Mrs. Ruth Wagner first arrived in New Guinea.  Missionaries Hintze and 
Strackbein took Reverend Wagner on a “Walkabout” to tour the out-
stations in the Highlands.  They left Yaramanda and were gone for four 
[4] days.  When they returned, they left again, three [3] days later, for 
another four [4] days.  This time they visited Raiakama, where the 
Wagners were to build their station, and witnessed a native reception.  
Walkabout” is a very common term.  It is a rather extensive 
hike of days or several weeks to survey new areas or to make 
arrangements with new communities to be served by native 
evangelists  
[Mission Newsletter. Let’s talk about a 
“walkabout” by Reverend Ian Kleinig].  
The missionaries reached the Enga, Duna, and Hewa locales throughout 
the Highlands, by “Walkabouts,” and to give you an idea of the paths 
they followed, and the mountains they climbed,

Word that they were coming had gone ahead of them, and as they came 
down the mountain, the “yodeling,” so to speak, of the carriers told them 
that they were near.  As they approached the station and were in sight of 
it, they noticed that branches had been placed across the road and that 
the native teacher, Tomaonec, and Ere, the interpreter, were standing 
behind it. 
Next
Our carriers dropped back, and alone, the missionaries walked up to 
the barricade and stopped.  Ere spoke a prayer in Pidgin…    
[Wagner Newsletter, May 1955]. 
The branches were symbolically lifted, and they were welcomed into the 
valley.  The missionaries shook hands for fifteen [15] minutes, going 
from one set of hands to another, along the line.  Shaking hands as a 
greeting had been introduced by missionaries and government men and 
almost was, by then, an accepted way of greeting your fellow man. 
Yaramanda is 5,600 feet above sea level and Raiakama is 6,200 feet.  
Since Reverend Wagner’s first “Walkabout”, he undertook many, many 
more to get to the people he needed to see throughout his working 
career in the Western Highlands of New Guinea.

Leaving New Guinea was a difficult choice for Reverend Bill and Mrs. Ruth 
Wagner.  They had spent fourteen years of their life in New Guinea and all 
of their children had been born there.  Therefore it was understandable 
that they would have mixed feelings about taking up a new life back home 
in the United States. 
Newly married and full of enthusiasm, they had arrived in March 1955, to 
bring the word of Christ to the peoples in the highlands of New Guinea.   
What made them more uneasy were stories they had heard about how 
much more difficult it was to adjust to life in their homeland than it was to 
adjust to life in a foreign land. 
But, the Wagner children were growing up and a decision had to be made 
about their future.  The Reverend Bill and Mrs. Ruth Wagner were torn 
between staying in Enga-land, or doing what was best for their daughters.  
As Reverend Wagner struggled with this, he finally came to a decision - 
Next
We have weighed the call to New Guinea to serve Engas with the 
Word of God and feel that after 14 years to want to serve the Lord 
elsewhere is not denouncing His call to serve Engas as a lesser 
call but merely a decision to try to do the best we can for our 
children, His gifts to us, while at the same time endeavoring to 
continue to serve in a new situation.  We do not feel that it is wise 
nor expedient to do one task at the expense of another when both 
are incumbent upon us [Wagner Newsletter, November 28, 1968].

The facts were that one teenage daughter was already 3,000 miles away 
attending one of the secondary schools in Australia and another daughter 
would be going there in two years to also further her education.  The 
Wagners realized that this was a difficult task for any child to endure. One 
of their daughters was living most of the time away from home and 
another would follow.  As parents, Reverend and Mrs. Ruth Wagner 
understood the isolation their daughter felt and they did not want to 
continue being separated from her or their other daughters for most of the 
time.

Our first Christmas there and how it had meant so much to us because

would be returning home from Luther College in Melbourne [Australia] 
to New Guinea for the family’s last Christmas together before going to 
America.  [Wagner Newsletter.  1968]
Although their future [at that time] was quite indefinite, the Wagners had 
found a new peace in their decision.  Reverend Wagner made inquiries 
about studying again before accepting a call into the parish ministry.  In 
the meantime, the Wagners would follow God’s guiding hand.  It had been 
arranged that another Pastor and his wife would replace them at their last 
mission station in Sirunki.  In all, the Wagners were in New Guinea from 
1955 at Raiakama, moved to Mambisanda in 1961, and then left Sirunki in 
1969, a total of 14 years in New Guinea; a place where the Wagners still 
refer to - as home. 
In the decision to leave for the USA, Mrs. Ruth Wagner looks back to the 
joy of her first memories of being in New Guinea - 
The Wagners and their five daughters left New Guinea for the United 
States in April of 1969.

THE WESTERN HIGHLANDS PROVINCE: The Enga People
Where is Enga Province?
Enga Province is one of the five (5) Highland Provinces in New Guinea, 
which includes Eastern Highlands, Western Highlands, Chimbu, and 
Southern Highlands. Enga lies towards the far north-western end of the 
Highlands region in New Guinea.   
Enga has five (5) District Regions:
1.Wabag Central District
2.Tsak Wapenamanda District
3.Lagaip Porgera District
4.Kompiam Ambum District
5.Kandep District
The provincial headquarter and the capital is centered in Wabag.
The Enga Province is the highest and most rugged in New Guinea.  It 
covers an area of 4942.2 square miles.   Much of the province is at 
altitudes of over 6561.7 feet.  Lower altitude areas are typically valleys, 
which form the watershed for the two major river systems that drain the 
province, the Lagaip [which is a tributary of the Fly] and the Lai [which is 
a tributary of the Wahgi] <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enga_Province>.

WHO ARE THE PEOPLE OF ENGA PROVINCE? - An Introduction 
Next
The traditional Enga settlement style is that of scattered homesteads 
dispersed throughout the landscape. Sweet potato is the staple food, 
sometimes (not often) supplemented by pork.  Pigs are a culturally valued 
item of exchange.  It is the elaborate systems of pig exchange that mark 
social life in the province.
In Enga society there is a strict segregation of sexes. Husband and wife do 
not share the same household unless the couple has tried to adopt the style 
of the Europeans.  In the true Enga culture, the women and girls live in a 
woman's house and the males and boys in a man's house.   Husbands and 
wives do not walk together; the man always peceding the wife down the 
road.  Only the wife takes care of the pigs and gardens the sweet potato.  
Her husband hunts, grows the sugarcane, builds houses, and prepares the 
mounds for his wife’s, or wives' sweet potato vines.
Who are the Enga people, you ask?  Well, the Enga are the largest linguistic 
and cultural group in all of Papua New Guinea.  They live on the western 
side of the Hagan Range in clan groups. The Enga people live mostly by 
subsistence farming. 
After getting settled in Raiakama, the Reverend William and Mrs. Wagner 
were ready to begin their work as missionaries with the Enga people of 
the Enga Province.

food, and then a layer of insulating dirt is added over the top. 
The food will cook for three or more hours, and when it is ready, the dirt

ENGA CONCEPTS: Overview
[Excerpt from Wagner Newsletter, Sept 24, 1963].
The Enga concepts of life and the world are practical, earthly concepts.  
They accept the world, the sun, the moon and the stars as something that 
is.  Their concept of a higher power is embodied in the “semongo", or the 
spirits of the deceased in their family, in their tribe or among their 
kinsmen.  These spirits frequent the places where the deceased lived their 
earthly lives, and can cause illness, death, poor crops, etc..
Their fables, which they tell and retell, deal with matters like planting 
gardens, gathering of produce from the garden, cooking food, eating food, 
or marrying, to name a few.  Another type of spirit enters into these fables; 
he is called “putututi” or “kanamongari”.  He can change his form and 
become human, an animal, an insect, a bird, or even a tree.  The Enga fear 
“putututi” as much as they fear “semongo", as they are both powerful 
spirits.

Family
The Enga family is a divided family.  Women, babies, all small children 
and all girls live in the women’s house.  Men and boys from five to eight 
and older all live in the men’s house. A man will build a women’s house 
near to the place where he lives in a men’s house and will have his wife 
live there, but there is a division which is hard to overcome.  
Discipline is very lax, and it is not uncommon for a young lad to sleep in 
his uncle’s house because his father wanted him to do a certain thing or 
because his father tried to correct him.  However, should a young lad 
become a discipline problem for the clan and repeatedly cause strife in 
the clan with thefts and misdemeanors, the clan will deal with him and 
sometimes deal harshly with him.  
Next
Birth
Women give birth to children in a spot removed from the house, a place 
overgrown with a considerable growth of wild can bushes and tall 
grasses.  If she has difficulty, she can cry for help, someone may come 
– it is not uncommon for a woman to have given birth to six or seven 
children and have only two reach maturity.  A child is not named at 
birth; the parents wait for a month or two to see if the child lives before 
naming him/her.

Shields: Warfare is a major aspect of Highland’s life, and shields are the 
supreme artistic expression connected with it.  Highland’s shields are 
used exclusively for combat and are not related to ceremonial 
occasions, as they are in other parts of Melanesia.  During periods of 
peace, they were usually stored in their owner’s abode above the fire or 
in the Men’s House.  The smoke of the fire blackened and hardened the 
timber, so that shields often lasted a century.  Periods of peace were 
always unstable, due to ever-changing alliances.  When warfare 
inevitable erupted, these stored shields were brought down, repainted, 
and used.     
Under the Australian colonial rule policy of “Pacification,” which was 
initiated in the Highlands from first contact in the 1930s through 
Independence in 1975, large scale inter-tribal warfare all but ceased.  
Even the smaller skirmishes were largely contained.  Many shields and 
other weapons were burned or discarded during this period, but during 
the late 1970s, both warfare and shield production began to revive.  
Highland’s shields were traditionally stone-adzed, but the introduction 
of steel blades has resulted in little alteration in shape, size, or design

Childhood
Children stay with the mother and the mother nurses them for at least 
four years before they are weaned.  After the children are weaned, the 
boys stay with their mother until they are able to look after their own 
needs to a large extent.  The exact age when a young lad leaves his 
mother and starts living with his father in the men’s house cannot be 
determined.  It varies from about five to eight years of age.  
Generally the children are carefree and have little responsibility.  The 
father shows the boy how to perform the work of the men and the 
mother shows the girl how to do the “women’s work”.  They are asked 
to carry firewood, weed the garden and draw drinking water from the 
spring.  Children have much time to play.

Houses
The houses the Enga people build serve their need in the climate.  The 
mountains cause the nights to be cold.  They build low houses with solid, 
more or less windproof walls and a grass roof.  
There is only one door to the house with a kyta or crash door built into the 
ceiling to the rear of the house.  In the event of a fire, the occupants can 
break through this door and out of the house, although it is never used 
except in the event of a fire.  
The front door to the house is an opening in the wall, and the door is 
closed by sliding doubled-over banana leaves back and forth on a pole 
which is fastened over the opening.  Quite often axe-hewn planks are 
placed one by one across the doorway in slots made by two upright posts 
to close the opening.  
A fire built in the main room of the house heats the house.  The smoke 
finds its way out through the grass, for there is no chimney.  These houses 
are very warm, even hot, and the Engas are thus able to sleep warmly 
without blankets.  Food is cooked on the fire and there are no cooking 
utensils.

Clan
The clan is concerned with its own existence, and all matters in the clan 
reflect this.  There are no declared chiefs or rulers in the clan.  A clan 
matter is usually brought up at the clan meeting place, a place where 
also clan ceremonies are held.  Everyone is free to speak, but of course 
the opinion of the most influential member of the clan will receive support 
much more so than the opinion of a “rubbish man” in the clan.  So it is 
the men with the most pigs, the most ground, the most wives and the 
most influence who rule the clan.  
The clan at one time carried on warfare with one or another of the 
neighboring clans.  A sort of dual code arose in this situation.  You 
could steal from the enemy but you could not ever steal from someone 
in your clan.  Outside of the clan, nothing was a felony and a particularly 
successful crime might even receive the praise of the perpetrator’s 
clansmen.

Marriage
In Enga society polygyny was practiced.  There wasn't a limit on the 
number of wives a man could have, but since there was the custom of 
paying a bride price, the number of wives was naturally tied up with what 
a man was able to afford.  
The marriage proper was carried out in the presence of a sorcerer, or 
"topori". 
A feast of cooked pig, the payment of the bride price, exchange of gifts 
and all having been completed, the “topori” says the proper magic 
formulas to ensure a good and fruitful married life.  
The taro plant, a plant with large leaves and an edible, starchy, tuberous 
root figures largely in the wedding ceremony.  A man and his newly 
acquired bride will go to a secluded place, and there will sit on the ground 
with their legs outstretched, facing each other so that the soles of his feet 
touch the soles of her feet.  They will then plant a taro between their 
outstretched legs at the place where the soles of their feet touch. They 
then live happily ever after.

As punishment for committing adultery, a husband would cut 
off the front of his wife's nose. This woman covers what was 
once her nose with a leaf.  However, a double standard exists; 
men are not punished for committing the same act.

Adultery
In former days, a husband would cut off his wife’s nose or the top of her 
ear or her fingers, her toes, or the back of her leg.  There would often 
be fights between clans because of adultery.  
The wife of an adulterous man might club the woman who had 
committed adultery with her husband.  
A change was implemented by the Australian government around 1955.  
There is not the same fear for adultery.  People serve a jail sentence for 
the repercussions of acts of revenge.

Death and Grief
Death resides in the house as one of the family, and all are acquainted 
with death.  Burial of the dead is the general rule. Some, however, 
depending on circumstances, were placed in holes or caves in cliffs, or 
thrown into a swiftly moving river or sunk in a quagmire.  
In burial the deceased is wrapped up to resemble a cocoon.  His body is 
then suspended between two poles and all gather around to mourn and 
wail.  To wail for one day is common but some will leave the body 
suspended between two poles and wail for two or three days.  
As an expression of grief when relative or loved one dies, one joint of a 
finger was severed.  There are often several deaths within a family.  This 
expression is practiced by men, women, and sometimes in the state of 
grief, the finger joint of a child will be taken.

frost either harms or kills the sweet potato vines.

Gardens
The economy among the Enga people is largely a subsistence economy.  
They plant gardens to supply their needs and since gardens grow all year 
long, year after year, they can live off their garden.  
Sweet potato, similar to the one we know, is the main food in their diet 
and there are over 30 varities.  Sugar cane, types of beans, taro, a 
spinach-like green, and other greens are also eaten.  Europeans 
introduced the pumpkin, corn, peanuts, and Irish potatoes to the Enga 
diet as well.

Each clan has a meeting place where ceremonies are held.  Quite often

only for men.  In this sacred grove, there is a house, usually inside or 
at the base of a tree, where the sacred stones are kept.  
The sacred stones are the link between the Enga people and deceased 
persons who are now spirits.  Each sacred stone is bathed in tree oil, 
and painted with natural or trade store color.  The Enga seek aid from 
the spirits via the stone.

Trade and Commerce
While the economy is largely subsistence, wealth being connected with 
pigs, gardens, etc., there is a kind of money used.  
In the Gulf of Papua, off the southern coast of Papua new Guinea, the 
shell of a large clam is taken from the coral reefs.  This shell is cut and 
polished to reveal its golden color.  The shell is five or six inches wide.  
This shell follows a trade route and has purchase value at each stop.  
It would be difficult to determine how a shell found in the Gulf of Papua 
reaches the Enga, but it comes to them via a people in the Hagen area 
and represents a pig, which means that somewhere a man gave a pig to 
obtain the shell.  This in then used as money, one shell equalling one pig.  
The shell is accepted at face value in paying a bride price, reparations in 
the Te Ceremony, obtaining a prized Aga Nut, or Tree Oil, etc.  
Next
The Enga later made money by growing and gathering dry blossoms of 
the Pyrethrum plant, then sold them to the Australian government as a 
knock-down agent in DDT.  The Australian government and the Mission 
introduced other 'cash crops' as well.  Listen Below -

the coast, produce a finer string for making lighter weight bags and 
the men's yambati.  Their skills are limited to tasks which are 
necessary for them to live, making the Enga people very utilitarian.

The Lutherans in New Guinea
German missionaries of the Neuendettelsau and Rhenish missions 
began the work in 1886, entering at two points on the north coast of 
what was then the new German colony of East New Guinea. The 
inhabitants, Melanesians and Papuans by race, were considered 
primitive.  Today in unexplored pockets in the inland mountains, there 
still live some of the most primitive people on earth; of all the mission 
fields of Asia this is the one where Western civilization has been the 
last to come.  The land is mountainous, forested and as might be 
expected, thinly populated.  The missionaries faced a tremendous 
problem of language.  In 1957, the half a million people populating 
the area of the Lutheran church were divided into sixty or eighty 
tribes and spoke as many different tongues.  During that time, in a 
single church district of 8,000 people four languages are used.  None 
of these languages had ever been put into writing.  The missionaries 
chose three of the principal languages as “church languages” and 
used them and interpreters for their work, adding “pidgin” which is an 
adaptation of English.   
The story of the development leading up to the remarkable 
organization that is the Lutheran Mission New Guinea has a dramatic 
history of missionary vision and loyalty, of the bond of faith bringing 
aid in the emergencies caused by two world wars, and of the final 
union in 1953 of German (Neuendettelsau), Australian (UELCA),  and 
the American (ALC, which replaced the Rhenish Mission) missions into 
a single internationally staffed and financed (with substantial 
subsidies from the LWF) organization.  It was equipped as never 
before to carry on in times that was critical for the development of 
the New Guinean people and for the church.

THE SOUTHERN HIGHLANDS PROVINCE 
The Duna and the Hewa People
Reverend Wagner made contact with the Duna by December 1964, and 
made exploratory trips into the Hewa Language area during their last 
mission circuit in New Guinea before going home to America.  
The Duna and the Hewa are from the western part of the Southern 
Highlands provinces. The Southern Highlands contains lush, high valleys 
sandwiched between towering limestone peaks. The region is 9,189 
square miles of remote and relatively undeveloped area.  The province 
contains the country's second-highest mountain, Mount Giluwe (14,330 
ft). Mendi is the capital town of this mountainous country.
The province is divided into roughly four distinct geographic regions, 
but for our purposes, we are only interested in number 1 - The West:
1.The West: Includes the districts of Tari, Koroba, Kopiago and Komo - 
the home of the Huli, 
Duna, and Hewa peoples

The Duna
The Duna Wigmen are proud warriors and have great reverence for birds, 
imitating them in ceremonial dances and decorating their wigs with 
feathers, flowers and cuscus fur.  Their wigs, like the Enga people, are 
woven from human hair, donated by their wives and children.  
Strawflowers are especially cultivated for use in their wigs, which is where 
the similarity with the Enga stops.  The Duna men also wear wig-rings 
made out of seeds that hang from their wigs, and not their ears.  A jingle 
can be heard with each step a Duna man takes.

conference, which was a body of over 26,000 communicant members who 
sent out evangelists and teachers to new areas in New Guinea.  They had

Reverend Wagner continued,
 
Just recently we were fortunate to be able to find a Duna 
speaker to help us prepare for the work in the Kapyokoo area 
[Kapyokoo is the Enga word for Kopiago area]… he is able to 
speak three languages: Duna, Ipi, and Enga…. However we 
found out that his Duna is limited.  We are now working 
among the Enga people and are separated from the Duna by 
people who speak Ipi… from Enga to Duna it is five days walk 
over some very mountainous and timbered country. For 
several days the path leads through the Ipi country where 
some people make gardens and live. 
 
The last several days of the journey is through timbered 
uninhabited country.  Recently, too, we hear “rumors” that 
the Kapyokoo area will not be opened until 1964

“The Duna and the Hewa living in the Kopiago sub-district 
number into the 7,000.  In the Wabag sub-district, Engas living in 
an area comparable to this are in number about 70,000.  This 
means that in reaching the people by hiking one reaches only 
about one-tenth as many people per mile of mountain hiked.  
Actually it is even less than that because the area settled by the 
Engas is very densely populated in fertile valleys separated by 
mountains where there are no people.  Duna too live in the many 
little valleys by nowhere is there any dense population.  Many 
hours and days have been spent on camping trips hiking around

The Hewa 
The word "Hewa" means stranger.
The Hewa extend into two provinces,  Enga and the Southern Highlands
,
 
and are a remarkably mobile highlands fringe people. They inhabit the area 
north and south of the lower Lagaip River in the most northwesterly corner 
of Southern Highlands Province, extending from the junction of the Lagaip, 
Strickland and Ok Om rivers east into Enga Province to roughly the 
Lagaip–Porgera river junction. 
Next
An extended family will live in a communal house, on stilts, 14 ft above the 
ground.  The large house is also 36 ft. wide and 26 ft. long.  It is made of 
split Pandanus logs tied with cane, which has a thatched roof of Pandanus 
leaves.  Men and women live in the same house; however, they are in 
separate areas.
The Hewa also engage in pig husbandry, and practice low-intensity swidden 
[slash and burn] agriculture based primarily on sweet potato cultivation.  
In addition to sweet potato, the Hewa cultivate a variety of local and 
introduced crops, including taro, banana, sago, pumpkin, cassava, 
breadfruit, corn, pawpaw and a number of leafy greens.  They supplement 
their diets through hunting, and spear-fishing in the Lagaip River, which is 
relied upon more than gardening.   
You can recognize Hewa men by their cone-shaped wigs, which are covered 
by a net.  Hewa women wear kuta skirts similar to the Enga women, but 
Hewa women wear a knitted string head veil with Job's Tear seed and 
cowrie shells sewn around the face line.

Rev. William Wagner speculates on exploratory trip into Hewa territory,
Next
“The most recent of the government patrols into the area established 
contacted and counted about nine hundred Hewas in four or five days of 
hiking.  We want to go into the area soon and bring the word of truth…it 
is going to be a difficult task.  Another language, more hiking and hiking 
in a different direction, not to mention the fact that there are no Hewas 
who speak Pidgin English, the language we use in making our contact.  
That means we have to use two interpreters, one to translate the Pidgin 
English we speak into the Duna Language and another to translate what 
the first interpreter has said in Duna into Hewa.  There are a few Duna 
who speak Hewa and we are told that there are a few Hewas on the 
perimeter of their area who speak Duna.  Five of the Hewa came into the 
Kopiago recently with the government patrol when it returned and they 
have now carried word of the outside world back to their people”

“In addition to the Duna work, just recently work among the Hewa came 
to light. Up until this time the population of the Hewa [was] just 
speculation as patrols by the Administration officers [Australian patrol 
officers] had failed to contact more than just a handful of the Hewa.  It is 
almost unbelievable to think that in the present age of rockets, satellites, 
hydrogen and super bombs, with travel a matter of hours between 
continents that there should be a portion of this earth untouched by 
outsiders where a people live an insular life with no contact with the 
world around them.  The Hewa may as well have lived on another planet 
and may as well have watched the world go drifting by...

Next
The Hewas just ten months ago were an unknown quantity. Their 
presence in a prescribed area was known because they had been seen 
from airplanes flying over the area, but no personal contact has been 
made with them because they lived over the mountains two days’ 
hiking distance from Lake Kopiago.  What mountains!  We followed the 
advice of our guide on one of our trips and we climbed from the Pori 
River up and up over the mountains to return to Kopiago.  We climbed 
for six hours, always up and up and at the very top we scaled the 
limestone cliff, pulling ourselves up with our hands on top of a ledge 
and our toes placed in toeholds in the face of the cliff.  The path was 
well defined and at no time were we in any danger of falling, but it was 
truly a climb.  We estimate that we climbed about 6,000 feet.  The Pori 
River as Papapuka is approximately 3.600 feet and the mountain is over 
10,000.  We now know the area better and will not climb that mountain 
again.  We plan our trip so as to go completely around the mountain 
and return on the other side of it.
  
Just a note. I am just now back from Hewa.  Terrible hiking, 6 hours 
up, up, and up.  Must have climbed 4,000 or 5,000 feet up…  The 
Hewa are people who live in houses on stilts.  At first because of the 
Pidgin English way of speaking, “Haus bilong em i stap antap long 
dewai,” our missionaries thought that their houses were built in trees.  
Jerry Arndt, [
who replaced Rev. Wagner while he came in for Kristen’s

stilts, sometimes as high as 14 ft above the ground.

In the past ten months we have spent a goodly share of our time 
hiking, and have had the misfortune of training three informants 
one after the other so that we have not progressed in the 
language to the point where we are able to use it capably.  We can 
speak Duna only haltingly… all in all it has been a hectic ten 
months, so that now the mountains are taller and the miles are 
longer and we are ready for furlough”, 
[Excerpt Wagner 
Newsletter, June 15, 1965].

In later years, the Hewa people came “within reach” in 1990, when 
an airstrip was completed at the Southern Highlands village of Wanakipa.  
Cont'd
Indeed, after this excursion, Reverend William Wagner rejoined his wife 
and children at Kopiago and then left on furlough July 14, 1965 for six 
months – When the Wagners returned from furlough, they continued 
their work with the Enga at Sirunki until May of 1969, when it was 
decided for the sake of their family to go back to the United States.

Highland Axes
The Uaa is the Enga and Duna word for axe.  Early axes were almost 
always wood hafted weapons, the heads of which were made of carved 
stone chipped to an edge.   As time progressed, metal-hafted and metal-
headed axes became more commonplace. Steel trade store axes have 
replaced stone axes in most of New Guinea. Stone was traditionally traded 
down from Highland quarries on both sides of the island to the rivers, 
swamps and coastal areas where any stone is scarce.  The different stones 
have names: Sambi - mottled stone; Morokea - black stone; Kunjina - 
black and grey stone [information provided by Kristen Wagner, Mrs. Ruth 
Wagner's daughter]

is also called mambu in Tok Pisin]. Two main types of flutes are played in 
New Guinea: the panpipe and single-tube flute [McLean, 1994: 17-24]. 
Panpipes are widely distributed in the Highlands, but are also found in 
many other locales [McLean, 1994: 17-19]. 
This station in Yaramanda was the home of Missionary Otto Hintze, one 
of the first missionaries in the Highlands, who was in charge of this 
circuit.
Yaramanda would be the Wagner’s home for the next two months, until 
they would continue on to Saka Raiakama to begin a new main station 
and a circuit of their own.  
 
 “This little grass house (below) is in Yaramanda, that is the first, that's 
where we came to when we came into the Highlands. and a.. Yaramanda 
was or is ahh.. a Mission station that was practically the second station 
that was ... umm.. started there in the Enga territory.. Otto Hintze was 
there, that would have been 1948, 1949, when he was there…so you are 
looking out over the valley and the Lai River is there.. This is the gorge 
for the Lai River”   
“This little grass house (left) is 
called ‘Strackman’s House” 
and Bill and I lived here before 
we went to Saka Raikama.  
When we arrived in New 
Guinea, we stayed with the 
Hintze family.  This picture 
was taken at their station in 
Yaramanda. We stayed there 
with them, ate there, had our 
bible study, wonderful 
conversations, and 
on Sunday, played games. This little grass house is where we slept 
because at that time, there were no facilities for other families in theirs.  
We just slept there.  The building off to the side is one of Otto's 
'Mitianda’  (on the right) It would be where he had church service.”

“I have only one image of the New Guinean Jew’s harp made from 
bamboo: it is when my father took me with him to Pausa [area in 
the Highlands], for the 25th Anniversary of the missionary work in 
New Guinea.  My recollection is faint, but I have a vision of a New 
Guinean man dressed in his native dress holding the Jew’s harp up 
to his lips with one hand, and with the other hand moving the string.  
The sound that was produced, as I dimly remember, was that of 
musical twangs.”

The Lutherans in New Guinea
German missionaries of the Neuendettelsau and Rhenish missions 
began the work in 1886, entering at two points on the north coast of 
what was then the new German colony of East New Guinea. The 
inhabitants, Melanesians and Papuans by race, were considered 
primitive.  Today in unexplored pockets in the inland mountains, there 
still live some of the most primitive people on earth; of all the mission 
fields of Asia this is the one where Western civilization has been the 
last to come.  The land is mountainous, forested and as might be 
expected, thinly populated.  The missionaries faced a tremendous 
problem of language.  In 1957, the half a million people populating 
the area of the Lutheran church were divided into sixty or eighty 
tribes and spoke as many different tongues.  During that time, in a 
single church district of 8,000 people four languages are used.  None 
of these languages had ever been put into writing.  The missionaries 
chose three of the principal languages as “church languages” and 
used them and interpreters for their work, adding “pidgin” which is an 
adaptation of English.   
The story of the development leading up to the remarkable 
organization that is the Lutheran Mission New Guinea has a dramatic 
history of missionary vision and loyalty, of the bond of faith bringing 
aid in the emergencies caused by two world wars, and of the final 
union in 1953 of German (Neuendettelsau), Australian (UELCA),  and 
the American (ALC, which replaced the Rhenish Mission) missions into 
a single internationally staffed and financed (with substantial 
subsidies from the LWF) organization.  It was equipped as never 
before to carry on in times that was critical for the development of 
the New Guinean people and for the church.

The PNG Highlands is one of the most democratic societies on earth. There 
are no chiefs, only big men, who are self-made. As a result, an effective 
form of wealth distribution has evolved.  To become and remain a big 
man, you must give frequent formal feasts in your community, and feasts 
mean pork.  As a sign of his status, the big man host wears a special 
woven apron when he kills the pigs at these feasts, and the tails of the 
pigs are always added to the apron to increase the prestige of the wearer.  
It is not possible to ritually kill the pigs unless you wear an apron, and for 
this reason, those who do not own one will rent them for the occasion for 
as much as Kina 50, about US$20 per day, which is big money in the 
Highlands <http://www.tribalartbrokers.net/details.asp?itemId=SIK>.

This station in Yaramanda was the home of Missionary Otto Hintze, one 
of the first missionaries in the Highlands, who was in charge of this 
circuit.
Yaramanda would be the Wagner’s home for the next two months, until 
they would continue on to Saka Raiakama to begin a new main station 
and a circuit of their own.  
 
 “This little grass house (below) is in Yaramanda, that is the first, that's 
where we came to when we came into the Highlands. and a.. Yaramanda 
was or is ahh.. a Mission station that was practically the second station 
that was ... umm.. started there in the Enga territory.. Otto Hintze was 
there, that would have been 1948, 1949, when he was there…so you are 
looking out over the valley and the Lai River is there.. This is the gorge 
for the Lai River”   
“This little grass house (left) is 
called ‘Strackman’s House” 
and Bill and I lived here before 
we went to Saka Raikama.  
When we arrived in New 
Guinea, we stayed with the 
Hintze family.  This picture 
was taken at their station in 
Yaramanda. We stayed there 
with them, ate there, had our 
bible study, wonderful 
conversations, and 
on Sunday, played games. This little grass house is where we slept 
because at that time, there were no facilities for other families in theirs.  
We just slept there.  The building off to the side is one of Otto's 
'Mitianda’  (on the right) It would be where he had church service.”

Carved stone objects – Mortars and pestles are found buried in Highland’s 
agricultural plots.  The stone mortars are often knobbed or ridged around 
the side and rim and the pestles and pounders are often simple.  They are 
believed to be at least 3,000 years old and suggest a society of seed 
grinders, although this practice has not taken place in the region within 
living memory.  The mortars are used in magic rituals and are treated as 
objects of power [http://www.tribalarts.com/feature/highlands/index.html].

Warfare is a major aspect of Highland life, and shields are the supreme 
artistic expression connected with it.  Highland shields are used 
exclusively for combat and are not related to ceremonial occasions as 
they are in other parts of Melanesia.  During periods of peace they were 
usually stored in their owner’s abode above the fire, like this shield.  The 
smoke of the fire blackened and hardened the timber so that shields 
often lasted a century.  Periods of peace were always unstable due to 
ever-changing alliances.  When warfare inevitably erupted, these stored 
shields were brought down, repainted, and used.  
Highland War Shield
Next
Under the Australian colonial rule policy of “Pacification,” which was 
initiated in the Highlands from first contact in the 1930s through 
Independence in 1975, large scale inter-tribal warfare all but ceased.  
Even the smaller skirmishes were largely contained.  Many shields and 
other weapons were burned or discarded during this period, but during 
the late 1970s both warfare and shield production began to revive.  
Highland shields were traditionally stone-adzed, but the introduction of 
steel blades has resulted in little alteration in shape, size, or design

Mrs. Ruth Wagner
Next
Miss Ruth Lilly Prueter was born on March 15, 1926, in Toledo, Ohio.  She 
graduated from the University of Toledo with a Bachelor of Education degree 
in 1948, teaching grades five and six in the Toledo Public School system 
from 1948 to 1954.   In September, 1953, she met William Wagner in West 
Bend, Wisconsin, where he had completed a year of vicarage. He graduated 
from Concordia Lutheran Seminary in Springfield, Illinois and received his 
call to the central highlands of New Guinea.  Ruth and William were married 
August 14, 1954, at the Memorial Lutheran Church –LCMS in Toledo, Ohio.  
Mission school followed at Concordia Lutheran Seminary, St. Louis, Missouri, 
and William was ordained as a pastor in January, 1955, at Greeley, 
Colorado.
Starting their life together, the couple served their Lord as missionaries in 
the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea for 14 years – 1955 through 
1969.  Ruth and her husband were blessed with five daughters, all born in 
Papua, New Guinea.  
The Wagner family returned to the United States in April, 1969.  Mrs. 
Wagner’s teaching career took off in the United States, where she taught in 
the inner city in St. Louis, Missouri, while her husband, Reverend William 
Wagner, did his Post-graduate study at the St. Louis Seminary, receiving his 
M.A.R. degree in 1970.  
After his graduation, Reverend Wagner was called as the pastor at St. Peter 
Lutheran Church in Gresham, Nebraska, and at Zion Lutheran Church in 
Thayer, Nebraska.  While there, Mrs. Ruth Wagner taught Kindergarten and 
Remedial Reading in Gresham and Surprise, Nebraska.  The family 
remained in Nebraska until 1977, when another move was in store for this 
couple and their five children.

==> text/197.txt <==
Reverend Wagner was then called to be Pastor at Grace Lutheran Church in 
Liberal, Kansas, and Mrs. Wagner taught at West Middle School for fifteen 
[15] years.  She retired from teaching in 1992, but that did not last long - 
she was a substitute teacher there as well, later working as a sales 
associate in a high-end boutique store.  She left Liberal in 1995, and moved 
to Wichita Kansas, where she again substituted, later taking a teaching 
position at Bethany Lutheran Church and School until retiring again in 2005.   
Mrs. Ruth Wagner is actively retired and involved with church, friends, and 
family.  
In 2005 and 2006, Mrs. Ruth Wagner donated collections of New Guinean 
artifacts to the Lowell D. Holmes Museum of Anthropology, located on the 
Wichita State University campus.  Many of the artifacts were gifts that had 
been presented to Reverend Wagner by the Enga, Duna, and Hewa 
clansmen during his time in New Guinea.  
As an educator, the imparting of knowledge is very important to Mrs. 
Wagner.  This attribute is an integral part of the mission of the Lowell D. 
Holmes Museum of Anthropology.  Although the museum is a teaching 
facility where students learn how to become museum professionals, it also 
provides an opportunity for visitors to become immersed in different 
cultures, thus learning more about the world around them.  
The donation of the collections will enable students, scholars, and the public 
alike to gain insight into the Wagners' life and vocation.  They will also learn 
about Papua New Guinea and about the Western and Southern Highland 
peoples who inhabit that region.
