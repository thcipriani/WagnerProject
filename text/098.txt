The Hewa 
The word "Hewa" means stranger.
The Hewa extend into two provinces,  Enga and the Southern Highlands
,
 
and are a remarkably mobile highlands fringe people. They inhabit the area 
north and south of the lower Lagaip River in the most northwesterly corner 
of Southern Highlands Province, extending from the junction of the Lagaip, 
Strickland and Ok Om rivers east into Enga Province to roughly the 
Lagaipâ€“Porgera river junction.

An extended family will live in a communal house, on stilts, 14 ft above the 
ground.  The large house is also 36 ft. wide and 26 ft. long.  It is made of 
split Pandanus logs tied with cane, which has a thatched roof of Pandanus 
leaves.  Men and women live in the same house; however, they are in 
separate areas.
The Hewa also engage in pig husbandry, and practice low-intensity swidden 
[slash and burn] agriculture based primarily on sweet potato cultivation.  
In addition to sweet potato, the Hewa cultivate a variety of local and 
introduced crops, including taro, banana, sago, pumpkin, cassava, 
breadfruit, corn, pawpaw and a number of leafy greens.  They supplement 
their diets through hunting, and spear-fishing in the Lagaip River, which is 
relied upon more than gardening.   
You can recognize Hewa men by their cone-shaped wigs, which are covered 
by a net.  Hewa women wear kuta skirts similar to the Enga women, but 
Hewa women wear a knitted string head veil with Job's Tear seed and 
cowrie shells sewn around the face line.
