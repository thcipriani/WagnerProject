Bone-tipped arrows are from the Southern Highlands and have a round 
palmwood foreshaft, incised and painted red and white with a human 
bone tip.  These arrows are particularly feared, as the human bone was 
known to cause an almost certainly fatal infection if any fragment 
remained in the wound.    
Childhood
Children stay with the mother and the mother nurses them for at least 
four years before they are weaned.  After the children are weaned, the 
boys stay with their mother until they are able to look after their own 
needs to a large extent.  The exact age when a young lad leaves his 
mother and starts living with his father in the men’s house cannot be 
determined.  It varies from about five to eight years of age.  
Generally the children are carefree and have little responsibility.  The 
father shows the boy how to perform the work of the men and the 
mother shows the girl how to do the “women’s work”.  They are asked 
to carry firewood, weed the garden and draw drinking water from the 
spring.  Children have much time to play.
