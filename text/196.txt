graduated from the University of Toledo with a Bachelor of Education degree 
in 1948, teaching grades five and six in the Toledo Public School system 
from 1948 to 1954.   In September, 1953, she met William Wagner in West

from Concordia Lutheran Seminary in Springfield, Illinois and received his 
call to the central highlands of New Guinea.  Ruth and William were married

Starting their life together, the couple served their Lord as missionaries in 
the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea for 14 years – 1955 through 
1969.  Ruth and her husband were blessed with five daughters, all born in 
Papua, New Guinea.  
The Wagner family returned to the United States in April, 1969.  Mrs. 
Wagner’s teaching career took off in the United States, where she taught in 
the inner city in St. Louis, Missouri, while her husband, Reverend William 
Wagner, did his Post-graduate study at the St. Louis Seminary, receiving his 
M.A.R. degree in 1970.  
After his graduation, Reverend Wagner was called as the pastor at St. Peter 
Lutheran Church in Gresham, Nebraska, and at Zion Lutheran Church in 
Thayer, Nebraska.  While there, Mrs. Ruth Wagner taught Kindergarten and 
Remedial Reading in Gresham and Surprise, Nebraska.  The family 
remained in Nebraska until 1977, when another move was in store for this 
couple and their five children.
