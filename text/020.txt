Bush houses, like the one Reverend William and Mrs. Ruth Wagner lived 
in when they arrived in Yaramanda and also similar to their living quarters 
in Saka Raiakama, were built mostly of saplings, trees, and grass, with 
sawn lumber only used for doors and door frames, window frames, and 
window sills.  
BUSH HOUSES - How they are built
These houses were only temporary accommodations for the missionaries, 
although they lived in them for years.  The Bush houses would eventually 
be replaced by permanent frame-houses built by mission carpenters.  
The Wagners would finally receive their permanent house in May of 
1958, and it had some modern conveniences, including piped-in water 
for the kitchen and bath.  This water came from a large metal tank 
designed to catch rain water.
