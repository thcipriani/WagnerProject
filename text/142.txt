The PNG Highlands is one of the most democratic societies on earth. There 
are no chiefs, only big men, who are self-made. As a result, an effective 
form of wealth distribution has evolved.  To become and remain a big 
man, you must give frequent formal feasts in your community, and feasts 
mean pork.  As a sign of his status, the big man host wears a special 
woven apron when he kills the pigs at these feasts, and the tails of the 
pigs are always added to the apron to increase the prestige of the wearer.  
It is not possible to ritually kill the pigs unless you wear an apron, and for 
this reason, those who do not own one will rent them for the occasion for 
as much as Kina 50, about US$20 per day, which is big money in the 
Highlands <http://www.tribalartbrokers.net/details.asp?itemId=SIK>.
