Warfare is a major aspect of Highland life, and shields are the supreme 
artistic expression connected with it.  Highland shields are used 
exclusively for combat and are not related to ceremonial occasions as 
they are in other parts of Melanesia.  During periods of peace they were 
usually stored in their owner’s abode above the fire, like this shield.  The 
smoke of the fire blackened and hardened the timber so that shields 
often lasted a century.  Periods of peace were always unstable due to 
ever-changing alliances.  When warfare inevitably erupted, these stored 
shields were brought down, repainted, and used.

Under the Australian colonial rule policy of “Pacification,” which was 
initiated in the Highlands from first contact in the 1930s through 
Independence in 1975, large scale inter-tribal warfare all but ceased.  
Even the smaller skirmishes were largely contained.  Many shields and 
other weapons were burned or discarded during this period, but during 
the late 1970s both warfare and shield production began to revive.  
Highland shields were traditionally stone-adzed, but the introduction of 
steel blades has resulted in little alteration in shape, size, or design
