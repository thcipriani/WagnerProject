Adultery
In former days, a husband would cut off his wifeâ€™s nose or the top of her 
ear or her fingers, her toes, or the back of her leg.  There would often 
be fights between clans because of adultery.  
The wife of an adulterous man might club the woman who had 
committed adultery with her husband.  
A change was implemented by the Australian government around 1955.  
There is not the same fear for adultery.  People serve a jail sentence for 
the repercussions of acts of revenge.
