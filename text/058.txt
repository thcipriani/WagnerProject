The Ceremonial Sing Sing can last for days, during which time many pigs, 
the geatest symbol of wealth, will be presented as gifts.  Men will slaughter 
the pigs and prepare a feast of pork. The women will bring the bananas, 
greens, and mapu [sweet potato] to add to the feast. 
But before a feast can begin, preparations will need to take place.  The 
men will dig a pit in the ground, and firewood and rocks are placed in the 
bottom. When the rocks are heated, layers of vegetables, pork, and greens 
are placed in the pit and covered, first with large leaves to protect the 
food, and then a layer of insulating dirt is added over the top. 
The food will cook for three or more hours, and when it is ready, the dirt 
and leaves are carefully removed. The food is then removed from the pit  
and guests will use plates of large leaves.  Any leftover food will be sent 
home with guests, indicating to all, the wealth and generosity of the host
