Rev. Wagner, who is living in Kopiago area while researching the Hewa, 
writes his wife Ruth, who is still in Sirunki about his exploratory "Walkabout"
Next
The Hewas just ten months ago were an unknown quantity. Their 
presence in a prescribed area was known because they had been seen 
from airplanes flying over the area, but no personal contact has been 
made with them because they lived over the mountains two days’ 
hiking distance from Lake Kopiago.  What mountains!  We followed the 
advice of our guide on one of our trips and we climbed from the Pori 
River up and up over the mountains to return to Kopiago.  We climbed 
for six hours, always up and up and at the very top we scaled the 
limestone cliff, pulling ourselves up with our hands on top of a ledge 
and our toes placed in toeholds in the face of the cliff.  The path was 
well defined and at no time were we in any danger of falling, but it was 
truly a climb.  We estimate that we climbed about 6,000 feet.  The Pori 
River as Papapuka is approximately 3.600 feet and the mountain is over 
10,000.  We now know the area better and will not climb that mountain 
again.  We plan our trip so as to go completely around the mountain 
and return on the other side of it.
  
Just a note. I am just now back from Hewa.  Terrible hiking, 6 hours 
up, up, and up.  Must have climbed 4,000 or 5,000 feet up…  The 
Hewa are people who live in houses on stilts.  At first because of the 
Pidgin English way of speaking, “Haus bilong em i stap antap long 
dewai,” our missionaries thought that their houses were built in trees.  
Jerry Arndt, [
who replaced Rev. Wagner while he came in for Kristen’s 
birth, the Wagner’s fifth daughter], 
said that they do live in houses on 
stilts, sometimes as high as 14 ft above the ground.
