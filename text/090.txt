THE SOUTHERN HIGHLANDS PROVINCE 
The Duna and the Hewa People
Reverend Wagner made contact with the Duna by December 1964, and 
made exploratory trips into the Hewa Language area during their last 
mission circuit in New Guinea before going home to America.  
The Duna and the Hewa are from the western part of the Southern 
Highlands provinces. The Southern Highlands contains lush, high valleys 
sandwiched between towering limestone peaks. The region is 9,189 
square miles of remote and relatively undeveloped area.  The province 
contains the country's second-highest mountain, Mount Giluwe (14,330 
ft). Mendi is the capital town of this mountainous country.
The province is divided into roughly four distinct geographic regions, 
but for our purposes, we are only interested in number 1 - The West:
1.The West: Includes the districts of Tari, Koroba, Kopiago and Komo - 
the home of the Huli, 
Duna, and Hewa peoples
. 
The Duna and the Hewa are from the Western part of the 
Southern Highland Provinces.  The Hewa live in the upper north-
western area, and the Duna live South-West of the Hewa.  'Click'

2.The Centre: Includes the districts of Margaraima, Nipa, Mendi and the

Heneng language.
