MRS. RUTH WAGNER - A Missionary Wife’s Life
The Enga women watched curiously and intently when Ruth hung out her 
wash.  The Enga women did not wash clothes because there were no 
clothes to wash; a woman's attire was limited to a reed or “kuta” skirt.  
But the Enga women, who ardently watched the missionary’s wife, 
gradually learned that they could go to her in times of trouble or sickness.  
The brown and white women learned to communicate, at first without 
words, later through an interpreter, and still later in literacy classes in the 
vernacular, which Ruth Wagner conducted [Conference Paper: "The Enga 
Woman"].   Ruth also gave medical attention to the Enga, and introduced 
the Lamaze Technique of childbirth to European mothers-to-be; this 
technique was developed in the 1940s.

In daily living, the duties were much the same as those of a housewife 
in the United States, except that the equipment she worked with was 
quite different.  The washing machine was a tall, cylindrical tub on legs 
with a large plunger actuated by a lever arrangement.  Two Enga 
Christian boys took turns to pump up and down. The hand wringer was 
moved back-and-forth from the machine to a supporting board in-
between the two rinsing tubs used for wringing the clothes. 
The ironing was done with a Coleman gas iron with a little tank attached 
to the rear, which is filled with gasoline for each ironing job, pumped 
with air, primed at the bottom and then ignited.
