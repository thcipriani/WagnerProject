In August 1964, Reverend Wagner entered the new area of Lake Kopiago, 
the home of the Duna people, and was able to compile a grammar of the 
Duna.

“The Duna and the Hewa living in the Kopiago sub-district 
number into the 7,000.  In the Wabag sub-district, Engas living in 
an area comparable to this are in number about 70,000.  This 
means that in reaching the people by hiking one reaches only 
about one-tenth as many people per mile of mountain hiked.  
Actually it is even less than that because the area settled by the 
Engas is very densely populated in fertile valleys separated by 
mountains where there are no people.  Duna too live in the many 
little valleys by nowhere is there any dense population.  Many 
hours and days have been spent on camping trips hiking around 
the Kopiago circuit, up mountains, down into river gorges, to 
establish the work”
