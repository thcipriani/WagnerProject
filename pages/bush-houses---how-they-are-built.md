Bush houses, like the one Reverend William and Mrs. Ruth Wagner lived
in when they arrived in Yaramanda and also similar to their living quarters
in Saka Raiakama, were built mostly of saplings, trees, and grass, with
sawn lumber only used for doors and door frames, window frames, and
window sills.

These houses were only temporary accommodations for the missionaries,
although they lived in them for years.  The Bush houses would eventually
be replaced by permanent frame-houses built by mission carpenters.
The Wagners would finally receive their permanent house in May of
1958, and it had some modern conveniences, including piped-in water
for the kitchen and bath.  This water came from a large metal tank
designed to catch rain water.
