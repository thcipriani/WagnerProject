Death resides in the house as one of the family, and all are acquainted
with death. Burial of the dead is the general rule. Some, however,
depending on circumstances, were placed in holes or caves in cliffs, or
thrown into a swiftly moving river or sunk in a quagmire.

In burial the deceased is wrapped up to resemble a cocoon. His body is
then suspended between two poles and all gather around to mourn and
wail. To wail for one day is common but some will leave the body
suspended between two poles and wail for two or three days.

As an expression of grief when relative or loved one dies, one joint of a
finger was severed. There are often several deaths within a family. This
expression is practiced by men, women, and sometimes in the state of
grief, the finger joint of a child will be taken.

> people, and oh, how many had lost parts of their fingers.”
> (A note written by Mrs. Ruth Wagner)

Especially in the Highlands, the death wail is also expressed when a killing
frost either harms or kills the sweet potato vines.
