To a New Guinean missionary -

> “Walkabout” is a very common term.  It is a rather extensive
> hike of days or several weeks to survey new areas or to make
> arrangements with new communities to be served by native
> evangelists (Mission Newsletter. Let’s talk about a “walkabout” by Reverend Ian Kleinig).

The missionaries reached the Enga, Duna, and Hewa locales throughout
the Highlands, by “Walkabouts,” and to give you an idea of the paths
they followed, and the mountains they climbed,


> Consider this incident of a descent and add a few more ascents
> and descents to it, to visualize a one-day journey.  We were above
> Makare, and the altimeter read 8,000 feet.  At Makare, forty-five
> minutes later, of which the last ten minutes were more or less
> level going, the altimeter read 6,600 feet – a drop of 1,400 feet in
> a little more than half an hour (Wagner Newsletter, pg 3, May 9, 1955).

The first “Walkabout” the Reverend Bill Wagner took was when he and
Mrs. Ruth Wagner first arrived in New Guinea.  Missionaries Hintze and
Strackbein took Reverend Wagner on a “Walkabout” to tour the out-
stations in the Highlands.  They left Yaramanda and were gone for four
(4) days.  When they returned, they left again, three (3) days later, for
another four (4) days.  This time they visited Raiakama, where the
Wagners were to build their station, and witnessed a native reception.

Word that they were coming had gone ahead of them, and as they came
down the mountain, the “yodeling,” so to speak, of the carriers told them
that they were near.  As they approached the station and were in sight of
it, they noticed that branches had been placed across the road and that
the native teacher, Tomaonec, and Ere, the interpreter, were standing
behind it.

> Our carriers dropped back, and alone, the missionaries walked up to
> the barricade and stopped.  Ere spoke a prayer in Pidgin… (Wagner Newsletter, May 1955).

The branches were symbolically lifted, and they were welcomed into the
valley.  The missionaries shook hands for fifteen (15) minutes, going
from one set of hands to another, along the line.  Shaking hands as a
greeting had been introduced by missionaries and government men and
almost was, by then, an accepted way of greeting your fellow man.
Yaramanda is 5,600 feet above sea level and Raiakama is 6,200 feet.

Since Reverend Wagner’s first “Walkabout”, he undertook many, many
more to get to the people he needed to see throughout his working
career in the Western Highlands of New Guinea.

Leaving New Guinea was a difficult choice for Reverend Bill and Mrs. Ruth
Wagner. They had spent fourteen years of their life in New Guinea and all
of their children had been born there. Therefore it was understandable
that they would have mixed feelings about taking up a new life back home
in the United States.

Newly married and full of enthusiasm, they had arrived in March 1955, to
bring the word of Christ to the peoples in the highlands of New Guinea.
What made them more uneasy were stories they had heard about how much
more difficult it was to adjust to life in their homeland than it was
to adjust to life in a foreign land.

But, the Wagner children were growing up and a decision had to be made
about their future. The Reverend Bill and Mrs. Ruth Wagner were torn
between staying in Enga-land, or doing what was best for their daughters.

As Reverend Wagner struggled with this, he finally came to a decision -

> “Next We have weighed the call to New Guinea to serve Engas with the
> Word of God and feel that after 14 years to want to serve the Lord
> elsewhere is not denouncing His call to serve Engas as a lesser
> call but merely a decision to try to do the best we can for our
> children, His gifts to us, while at the same time endeavoring to
> continue to serve in a new situation. We do not feel that it is wise
> nor expedient to do one task at the expense of another when both
> are incumbent upon us” (Wagner Newsletter, November 28, 1968).

The facts were that one teenage daughter was already 3,000 miles away
attending one of the secondary schools in Australia and another daughter
would be going there in two years to also further her education. The
Wagners realized that this was a difficult task for any child to endure.
One of their daughters was living most of the time away from home and
another would follow. As parents, Reverend and Mrs. Ruth Wagner
understood the isolation their daughter felt and they did not want to
continue being separated from her or their other daughters for most of
the time.

In the decision to leave for the USA, Mrs. Ruth Wagner looks back to the
joy of her first memories of being in New Guinea -

> Our first Christmas there and how it had meant so much to us because
> Sarah, our first born, had arrived one month earlier.  But now, Sarah
> would be returning home from Luther College in Melbourne (Australia)
> to New Guinea for the family’s last Christmas together before going to
> America. (Wagner Newsletter. 1968)

Although their future [at that time] was quite indefinite, the Wagners had
found a new peace in their decision. Reverend Wagner made inquiries about
studying again before accepting a call into the parish ministry. In the
meantime, the Wagners would follow God’s guiding hand. It had been arranged
that another Pastor and his wife would replace them at their last mission
station in Sirunki. In all, the Wagners were in New Guinea from 1955 at
Raiakama, moved to Mambisanda in 1961, and then left Sirunki in 1969, a
total of 14 years in New Guinea; a place where the Wagners still refer to
- as home.

The Wagners and their five daughters left New Guinea for the United
States in April of 1969.
