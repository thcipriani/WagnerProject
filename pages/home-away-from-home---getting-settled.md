Four months later, in August 1955, the Wagners officially moved to
Raiakama and began work at the new main station.  The house where
they would live would take some getting used to.  Mrs. Ruth Wagner
states:

> “The first sight of our home was almost like looking at a lone
> tree in the midst of dirt”
> (Wagner Newsletter, pg 7, September 1955).

She continues to explain the nature of Bush house:

There were two rooms in the Bush house, each 15’ x 15’, of which one
was their bedroom.  This room was also a semi-storage room and
contained a shower.  The shower was a converted milking bucket with a
hose attached underneath, resembling a sprinkler can, and manipulated
up and down by means of a rope and pulley.  Water was heated on the
stove and brought to the bathroom.

The other room, a kitchen, contained a food-safe for the storage of food,
which was partly enclosed by a screen. There was a cabinet similar to a
buffet with two drawers on top and two large doors with shelves inside, a
6’ x 42” table which could easily accomodate ten people, four chairs, the
wood stove and firewood box, a counter and shelves along one side, a
shelf for holding the water buckets, plus odds-and-ends in corners and
various articles hanging on the walls.

The ceiling in the house had large strips of waterproof tar paper nailed to
saplings, with the paper extending from one end of the house to the
other.  This ceiling afforded a catch-all for fragments from the saplings
above dropping onto the table, food, bed, etc.  The walls were two [2]
layers of blind with kunai grass in between as insulation in which small
rats scurried up and down and also under the Wagners' bed.  Mouse traps
were not strong enough to catch these rats.  Reverend William Wagner
used a hammer at night; he learned to be quick getting out of bed.   Rats
were frequent visitors in all bush houses, and cats were also very helpful
to keep down their population [Wagner Oral Slide History].
