In March 1955, Reverend William and Ruth Wagner's plane touched down in
New Guinea.  Reverend Wagner writes:

> “As our plane circled over Yaramanda, we could see people running
> out of houses and looking up at us.  The plane continued on a short
> distance; we looked back and saw the crowd dissolve into a line and
> the far end of the line start toward the air-strip.  The crowd came
> streaming down the hill as the plane came over the strip and
> dropped down to land.  The Cessna taxied to a stop and the moment
> the propeller stopped turning the plane was surrounded by a
> hundred or more natives.  Everyone wanted to shake hands with us
> and welcome us to Yaramanda.  To whooping and the chanting, we
> climbed the long hill to the station.  We had arrived in New Guinea.”
> (Wagner Newsletter, May 9, 1955).

Their first stop was the station at Yaramanda, the home of pioneer
Missionary Otto Hintze, one of the first missionaries in the Highlands
(arrival in 1948), who was in charge of this circuit. This would be the
Wagner's home for the next two months, until they would continue on to
Saka Raiakama to begin a new main station and circuit of their own.
