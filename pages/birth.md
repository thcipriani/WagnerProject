Women give birth to children in a spot removed from the house, a place
overgrown with a considerable growth of wild cane bushes and tall
grasses.  If she has difficutly, she can cry for help, someone may come.
It is not uncommon for a woman to have given birth to six or seven
children and have only two reach maturity.  A child is not named at
birth; the parents wait a month or two to see if the child lives before
naming him/her.
