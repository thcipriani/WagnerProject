## Clothing

The days are warm, and therefore, there is no need for warm
clothing.

The Enga man wears no clothing to cover his body from the waist up,
and walks barefooted. He wears a belt made of string or rope, which
he has made himself. Some have acquired a leather belt to put
around his waist, with the “yabati,” an apron-like woven garment in
the front and a bunch of leaves in the rear. The little boys
approximently 12 years old and under wear nothing but a smile.

The Enga woman wears a two-section skirt or “Kuta” fastened around
her waist covering the front and the rear. The Enga girls also wear
“kuta” skirts, just like their mothers.

The "kuta" is made of reeds which are grown in a small pond much like
the cultivation of rice in Asia.  These reeds are harvested and attached
to a belt.
