## Reverend William P. Wagner - His Missionary Duties

Reverend Wagner worked long days in the Western Highlands of New
Guinea and did it all on his Indian motorcyle, later replaced by two [2]
other bikes, but the Indian was his favorite.  His work took him to the
hydroplant, the hospital, the prison, carpentry duties, repairing the Land
Rovers, and preparing lessons for language classes.

Twice a week, Reverend Wagner taught at the government school, and
also held class for missionaries who had not mastered the Enga language.
During the mornings, he taught religion at one of the mission schools and
also taught religion classes for the ‘Doctor Boys,’ who were young Enga
men trained by a medical team to help the MDs.  The 'Doctor Boy' worked
in a 'Haus Sik' which is a Pidgin word for clinic.  These  clinics were
located at many of the mission stations.

While at Mambisanda, in the afternoons, Reverend Wagner fulfilled his
duties as the New Guinean prison chaplain at Wapenamanda, where he
would give counsel and hold services for the inmates.  The Warden,
prison guards, policemen, and other prison personnel would also gather
their families to listen to Reverend Wagner's Gospel as he was also their
pastor.  A Bible class was held for them following service.

One evening a week, he prepared Enga policemen and their families for
baptisms; also on another evening, missionaries and their families
gathered for Bible study led by Reverend Wagner.

On Fridays, he instructed Enga evangelists and elders of the
congregations in his territory.  Reverend Wagner was a very busy man.

A typical Sunday for Reverend Wagner consisted of five to six church
services for missionary personnel stationed in or around Mambisanda.
He would then walk three or so miles to reach one of the out-station
churches where he would conduct one or two communion services in the
Enga tongue.

He was also hospital chaplain, counseling elders of his congregation who
visited Enga patients.  When missionaries, their wives, or other European
patients were registered, he or his wife, Mrs. Ruth Wagner, visited them
personally.

Reverend Wagner also set aside two nights a week for study and prayer.
This time was guarded and employed conscientiously because without
consistent study, the rest of his program would become empty and futlle.
Reverend Wagner worked 60 hours a week, but this was not all -

In a culture that had never seen the wheel, a screw, or a nail, developing
tradesmen like carpenters, electricians, or mechanics was a difficult job.
So, Reverend Wagner worked on the complex engines in Land Rovers and
dynamos in hydro and diesel electric plants.  He serviced and maintained
the power plant, motorcycles, and other power equipment that kept the
mission station at Mambisanda in working order.

In one instance, a nurse at one of the out-stations had just radioed in
that her motorcycle had broken down and no one could fix it.  This
emergency was for Reverend Wagner, because tomorrow she must visit
the sick with medicine (May, Edward C., "Triple-Threat Missionary," The
Lutheran Witness. Jan. 21, 1964).
