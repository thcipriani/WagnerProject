Many people asked how the Wagners celebrated Christmas in the
Highlands.  Native teachers and evangelists in their circuit along with their
families came to the station for a Christmas party.  After a simple church
service in the Mission’s teacher’s house, which included the sermon and
Christmas carols sung in Pidgin English, the group retired to another room
with a fire burning in the center for warmth and light.

> “Here we played “Button, button, who’s got the button?” with a
> small potato and the natives literally rolled on the floor with
> laughter.  This game they have never played before.  The food
> served was quite strange to them and included whole wheat
> bread sandwiches of fish and cheese, oatmeal cookies and candy.
> Even the bread, they said, was sweet.  When they first tasted the
> food they held it gingerly and took very little bites, but all of it
> was eaten except the cookies.  They were too sweet.  Later, gifts
> were distributed for the Mission Cheer Committee to each
> family”. (Wagner Newsletter, March 1955)

Celebrating the family Christmas at home in their ‘Bush’ house, Mrs. Ruth
Wagner states:

> “In our little home there was a simple Christmas tree on the table
> made of branches of the Napi tree on which were hung tiny
> ornaments and tinsel sent by friends in the States.  With a piece
> of a white sheet underneath around the tin can in which the tree
> rested, with boxes from home waiting to be opened, with Sarah
> (Reverend William and Ruth’s first daughter) in her bassinet and
> the story of the birth of Jesus still sounding in our hearts we had
> a lovely, simple Christmas eve”. (Wagner Newsletter, March 1955)
