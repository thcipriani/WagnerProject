Each clan has a meeting place where ceremonies are held. Quite often
near this place there is a sort of sacred grove of trees. Women, girls
or young boys are not allowed to go inside this grove, as this is a place
only for men. In this sacred grove, there is a house, usually inside or
at the base of a tree, where the sacred stones are kept.

The sacred stones are the link between the Enga people and deceased
persons who are now spirits. Each sacred stone is bathed in tree oil,
and painted with natural or trade store color. The Enga seek aid from
the spirits via the stone.
