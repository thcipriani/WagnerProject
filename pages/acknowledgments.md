I would like to give special thanks to all the people who helped put this
project together.  I will first start with Mrs. Ruth Wagner, whose generous
spirit, delightful enthusiasm, and sense of humor, made the project
possible.

I would also like to thank Mr. Jerry Martin, Dr. David Hughes, Dr. Dorothy
Billings, and Dr. Jay Price, whose help and guidance kept me on a straight
and narrow path.  Additionally, I would like to thank Sue Cowdery, the
Registrar at the Lowell D. Holmes Museum of Anthropology, and other
museum students for all their help with the collection throughout this
project.

Special thanks to Muhammad Jamil for his computer savviness and
expertise.  He played an integral role in incorporating flash and special
effects into my website. Thanks to Macc for the web book template, for
without it, the pages would not turn - an aspect very important for the
book effect.  Also, thanks to Troy Belford for educating me on various
aspects of film editing technology.  His expertise in converting from
analog to digital media provided me with much insight.
Last but not least, I would like to thank my loving family, Michael and
Tyler, without whose support this project would never have gotten off the
ground.  To one and all, a very big and heartfelt Thank You!
