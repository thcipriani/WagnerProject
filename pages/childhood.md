Children stay with the mother and the mother nurses them for at least
four years before they are weaned.  After the children are weaned, the
boys stay with their mother until they are able to look after their own needs
to a large extent.  The exact age when a young lad leaves his mother and
starts living with his father in the men's house cannot be determined.  It
varies from about five to eight years of age.

Generally the children are carefree and have little responsibility.  The father
shows the boy how to preform the work of the men, and the mother shows
the girl how to do "woman's work."  Girls are taught to carry firewood, weed
the garden, and draw drinking water from the spring. Children have much
time to play.
