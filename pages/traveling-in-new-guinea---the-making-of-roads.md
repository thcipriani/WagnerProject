Until 1954, traffic problems were nonexistent; there were no roads or
bridges.  If anyone wanted to go anywhere, he walked – not over nice,
graveled paths, but up and down grassy clay trails which also served as
gutters to drain the rains off the mountains.  Later on, the first traffic
“problem” developed.  The local Australian government officer purchased a
Land Rover (a British Jeep) and then the mission received as a gift, a Land
Rover as well, considering the possibility, however remote, that these two
Land Rovers might meet head on at a sharp bend in the only (singular)
mountain road, something had to be done.  By 1956, there were over
some 120 miles of road in the Wabag and Laiagam sub districts.

Roads were carved out of the mountains with pick, shovel, and the force of
numbers, as this was the only means at hand to build roads. And even
though more and more roads were being built by the Enga and Duna
people, transportation in the immediate area where the Wagner’s lived,
was very limited.  The missionaries did a great deal of walking and the
Enga carried supplies, lumber, etc., on their backs.

The mission territory on the whole, owned eight four-wheel drive jeeps
and a truck.  Each mission station may have had one jeep, but the mission
also had twenty-one (21) motorcycles which everyone traveled by.

The carpenters went  to work on motorcycles; the teachers visited their
schools on motorcycles.  The evangelistic missionaries reached as many
out-stations as possible by motorcycle, each as far as the road could take
them, and then it was by foot again.  To connect roads and to cross rivers,
bridges had to be put in place.
