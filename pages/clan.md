## Clan

The clan is concerned with its own existence, and all matters in the clan
reflect this. There are no declared chiefs or rulers in the clan. A clan
matter is usually brought up at the clan meeting place, a place where
also clan ceremonies are held. Everyone is free to speak, but of course
the opinion of the most influential member of the clan will receive support
much more so than the opinion of a “rubbish man” in the clan. So it is
the men with the most pigs, the most ground, the most wives and the
most influence who rule the clan.

The clan at one time carried on warfare with one or another of the
neighboring clans. A sort of dual code arose in this situation. You
could steal from the enemy but you could not ever steal from someone
in your clan. Outside of the clan, nothing was a felony and a particularly
successful crime might even receive the praise of the perpetrator’s
clansmen.
