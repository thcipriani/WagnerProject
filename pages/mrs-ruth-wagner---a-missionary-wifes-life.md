## MRS. RUTH WAGNER - A Missionary Wife's Life

The Enga women watched curiously and intently when Ruth hung out her
wash.  The Enga women did not wash clothes because there were no
clothes to wash; a woman's attire was limited to a reed or “kuta” skirt.
But the Enga women, who ardently watched the missionary’s wife,
gradually learned that they could go to her in times of trouble or sickness.
The brown and white women learned to communicate, at first without
words, later through an interpreter, and still later in literacy classes in the
vernacular, which Ruth Wagner conducted [Conference Paper: "The Enga
Woman"].   Ruth also gave medical attention to the Enga, and introduced
the Lamaze Technique of childbirth to European mothers-to-be; this
technique was developed in the 1940s.

In daily living, the duties were much the same as those of a housewife
in the United States, except that the equipment she worked with was
quite different.  The washing machine was a tall, cylindrical tub on legs
with a large plunger actuated by a lever arrangement.  Two Enga
Christian boys took turns to pump up and down. The hand wringer was
moved back-and-forth from the machine to a supporting board in-
between the two rinsing tubs used for wringing the clothes.
The ironing was done with a Coleman gas iron with a little tank attached
to the rear, which is filled with gasoline for each ironing job, pumped
with air, primed at the bottom and then ignited.

For cooking, the Australian stove was boxed-in and filled with dirt on
three sides, to prevent the loss of heat.  It had the firebox on top and
oven underneath, and if there were strong winds, too much wood, they
would quickly send the oven temperature to 450 degrees or more,
resulting in many semi-baking failures.  During the next few years, Mrs.
Ruth Wagner would learn to control the heat.

The housewife in New Guinea had no store to visit to purchase her daily
food, and until her gardens were planted and began producing, some of
their fruits and all of their vegetables were bought from the Enga women,
who came to the house twice a week, carrying the food in their billums.

Since the Enga women did almost all of the gardening, it was usually they
who came to sell, although some school boys and men also appeared.
Enga women coming home from their gardens bear unbelievable amounts
of food in billums on their backs often with a small child perched on top.
The weight was so great that they were often walking bent over.

For beads, money, or newspaper, missionary wives bought green beans,
peas, cabbage, onions, potatoes, mapu – the white sweet potato, the
Engas’ main item of diet, occasional yams,  kumu - the native spinach,
pumpkin greens, corn, several varieties of bananas, papaya, tomatoes,
and chicken eggs to supplement their diet (WNL).
