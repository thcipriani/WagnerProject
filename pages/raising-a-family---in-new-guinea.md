## RAISING A FAMILY - In New Guinea

Sarah, shown with her mother, Ruth, was born at Jagaum Lutheran
Hospital near Madang – which is on the New Guinean coast.  Mrs. Ruth
Wagner went there because the hospital in their mission circuit was still
under construction.  Ruth and baby Sarah flew back from the coastal
hospital to the government airstrip and station at Wapenamada, where
they took the mission Landrover to Mambisanda and waited for Reverend
Wagner to arrive.  They then would head back to their home at Raiakama,
in the Saka Valley.

> “Bill saw Sarah for the first time that same morning they left for
> Saka Laiagam, with Reverend Bill walking and Ruth in a chair
> carried by Engas as she was not allowed to climb up and down
> cliff sides and valleys.  Sarah wrapped in blankets and lying on a
> “turi” in her “bilum”, traveling Enga fashion on the back of our
> houseboy” (Wagner Newsletter, Dec 1955).

Sarah is the Reverend and Mrs. Wagner’s first child; she was born in New
Guinea.  Throughout the couple’s fourteen years with the Enga, Duna,
and Hewa people, the Wagners had five beautiful daughters; Sarah,
Jennifer, Stephanie, Lisa, and Kristen; all were born in New Guinea.

Being a new mother was always a learning experience, but caring for a
new baby in New Guinea with just the barest of essentials needed to care
for her was difficult, and had, of course, changed the couple’s daily
routine.   Washing was now done at least three times a week, two baby
washes were boiled in the copper outside, and one washed with the
regular wash.

The copper was a large basin which held about ten gallons of water and
rested in the top of a 44-gallon gasoline drum.  A hole had been cut in the
side of the drum at the bottom, and the houseboy built a fire inside to heat
the water.  A little chimney near the top permitted the smoke to escape.
There was no automatic washer to keep things clean and water was carried
from such a distance that conservation was often necessary.  It required a
good half hour to carry water from the spring in two buckets hung on a
pole resting on the shoulders.  About thirteen buckets of water were
needed to fill two rinsing tubs and the copper, in which the washing water
was heated.  In addition, from four to six buckets were kept filled in the
house for daily use.

> “Sarah is now four months old and the natives are very excited
> about seeing a white child.  When she went to church for the
> first time since Christmas a few weeks ago, the reaction was
> unexpected.  Very little attention was given to the sermon, and
> when she started for home, the women and children, the men
> being more reserved and just smiling, shouted and laughed,
> reached up as if to touch her, shook their hands in front of
> themselves as we do to get our hands warm when they are
> cold, their expressions of surprise and amazement, and kept
> repeating – “Wamo! Wamo!”  (The Enga expression of surprise).
> The parade followed her to the gate to our yard and Sarah sat
> up in her daddy’s arm and just looked back at them.  Yes, it
> must be strange for them to see a father carry his tiny
> daughter, for that is something only the women do in the native
> society” (Wagner Newsletter, March 1955).
