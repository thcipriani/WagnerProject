After getting settles in Raiakama, the Reverend Willian and Mrs. Wagner
were ready to begin their work as missionaries with the Enga people
of the Enga Province.

Who are the Enga people you ask?  Well, the Enga are the largest linguistic
and cultural group in all of Paupa New Guinea.  They live on the Western side
of the Hagan Range in clan groups.  The Enga people live mostly by
subsistance farming.

The traditional Enga settlement style is that of scattered homesteads
dispersed throughout the landscape. Sweet potato is the staple food,
sometimes (not often) supplemented by pork. Pigs are a culturally valued
item of exchange. It is the elaborate systems of pig exchange that mark
social life in the province.

In Enga society there is a strict segregation of sexes. Husband and wife do
not share the same household unless the couple has tried to adopt the style
of the Europeans. In the true Enga culture, the women and girls live in a
woman's house and the males and boys in a man's house. Husbands and
wives do not walk together; the man always peceding the wife down the
road. Only the wife takes care of the pigs and gardens the sweet potato.
Her husband hunts, grows the sugarcane, builds houses, and prepares the
mounds for his wife’s, or wives' sweet potato vines.

        this identifies them both as Enga. The shape of their
        wig is also another identifier. "Carefully built wigs
        are said to provide a resting place for the spirits,
        to enhance one's powers"[V. Harbutt]. Also, tree-oil

The Ceremonial Sing Sing can last for days, during which time many pigs,
the geatest symbol of wealth, will be presented as gifts. Men will slaughter
the pigs and prepare a feast of pork. The women will bring the bananas,
greens, and mapu [sweet potato] to add to the feast.

But before a feast can begin, preparations will need to take place. The
men will dig a pit in the ground, and firewood and rocks are placed in the
bottom. When the rocks are heated, layers of vegetables, pork, and greens
are placed in the pit and covered, first with large leaves to protect the
food, and then a layer of insulating dirt is added over the top.

The food will cook for three or more hours, and when it is ready, the dirt
and leaves are carefully removed. The food is then removed from the pit
and guests will use plates of large leaves. Any leftover food will be sent
home with guests, indicating to all, the wealth and generosity of the host
