The Enga man is adept with an axe. His axe is used to chop firewood,
build a house, clear a garden and is used for self defense, sometimes war.

The Enga woman can twist the bark fibers available to her into a small
string for stringing seeds or turn it into a large string for weaving her
net bag. Bark fibers made into string produce bags used to carry
heavy loads. Fibers from the sisal plant, which was introduced from
the coast, produce a finer string for making lighter weight bags and
the men's yambati. Their skills are limited to tasks which are necessary
for them to live, making the Enga people very utilitarian.

The Lutherans in New Guinea
German missionaries of the Neuendettelsau and Rhenish missions
began the work in 1886, entering at two points on the north coast of
what was then the new German colony of East New Guinea. The
inhabitants, Melanesians and Papuans by race, were considered
primitive.  Today in unexplored pockets in the inland mountains, there
still live some of the most primitive people on earth; of all the mission
fields of Asia this is the one where Western civilization has been the
last to come.  The land is mountainous, forested and as might be
expected, thinly populated.  The missionaries faced a tremendous
problem of language.  In 1957, the half a million people populating
the area of the Lutheran church were divided into sixty or eighty
tribes and spoke as many different tongues.  During that time, in a
single church district of 8,000 people four languages are used.  None
of these languages had ever been put into writing.  The missionaries
chose three of the principal languages as “church languages” and
used them and interpreters for their work, adding “pidgin” which is an
adaptation of English.
The story of the development leading up to the remarkable
organization that is the Lutheran Mission New Guinea has a dramatic
history of missionary vision and loyalty, of the bond of faith bringing
aid in the emergencies caused by two world wars, and of the final
union in 1953 of German (Neuendettelsau), Australian (UELCA),  and
the American (ALC, which replaced the Rhenish Mission) missions into
a single internationally staffed and financed (with substantial
subsidies from the LWF) organization.  It was equipped as never
before to carry on in times that was critical for the development of
the New Guinean people and for the church.

Money - notes and silver - is used everywhere.
Shirts, dresses, trousers, loin cloths, sandals, bicycles, cooking utensils,

THE SOUTHERN HIGHLANDS PROVINCE
The Duna and the Hewa People
Reverend Wagner made contact with the Duna by December 1964, and
made exploratory trips into the Hewa Language area during their last
mission circuit in New Guinea before going home to America.
The Duna and the Hewa are from the western part of the Southern
Highlands provinces. The Southern Highlands contains lush, high valleys
sandwiched between towering limestone peaks. The region is 9,189
square miles of remote and relatively undeveloped area.  The province
contains the country's second-highest mountain, Mount Giluwe (14,330
ft). Mendi is the capital town of this mountainous country.
The province is divided into roughly four distinct geographic regions,
but for our purposes, we are only interested in number 1 - The West:
1.The West: Includes the districts of Tari, Koroba, Kopiago and Komo -
the home of the Huli,
Duna, and Hewa peoples
.
The Duna and the Hewa are from the Western part of the
Southern Highland Provinces.  The Hewa live in the upper north-
western area, and the Duna live South-West of the Hewa.  'Click'

2.The Centre: Includes the districts of Margaraima, Nipa, Mendi and the
Lai Valley, and is the home of the speakers of dialects of the Anggal
Heneng language.

4.The Lowlands: Stretch across the southern part of the Southern
Highlands province from the volcanic peaks of Mount Bosavi to include the
oilfields of Lake Kutubu, and includes the language groups of Biami
[shared with Western Province] Foe, and Fasu. [Excerpt from Wikapedia,

The Duna
The Duna Wigmen are proud warriors and have great reverence for birds,
imitating them in ceremonial dances and decorating their wigs with
feathers, flowers and cuscus fur.  Their wigs, like the Enga people, are
woven from human hair, donated by their wives and children.
Strawflowers are especially cultivated for use in their wigs, which is where
the similarity with the Enga stops.  The Duna men also wear wig-rings
made out of seeds that hang from their wigs, and not their ears.  A jingle
can be heard with each step a Duna man takes.

Reverend Wagner, studying the Duna language, was in anticipation of
working with the Duna people, hoping that the Kapyokoo area would be
open to missionaries by July 1963.  This did not happen.
Later in the year, he had gone to a Wabag Lutheran Church [W.L.C.]
conference, which was a body of over 26,000 communicant members who
sent out evangelists and teachers to new areas in New Guinea.  They had
Next
approved the sending of twenty men into the Kapyokoo area
[where the Duna live]..., as soon as it is opened

[Wagner Newsletter, Sept. 24, 1963].
Reverend Wagner continued,

Just recently we were fortunate to be able to find a Duna
speaker to help us prepare for the work in the Kapyokoo area
[Kapyokoo is the Enga word for Kopiago area]… he is able to
speak three languages: Duna, Ipi, and Enga…. However we
found out that his Duna is limited.  We are now working
among the Enga people and are separated from the Duna by
people who speak Ipi… from Enga to Duna it is five days walk
over some very mountainous and timbered country. For
several days the path leads through the Ipi country where
some people make gardens and live.

The last several days of the journey is through timbered
uninhabited country.  Recently, too, we hear “rumors” that
the Kapyokoo area will not be opened until 1964

In August 1964, Reverend Wagner entered the new area of Lake Kopiago,
the home of the Duna people, and was able to compile a grammar of the
Duna.
Next
“The Duna and the Hewa living in the Kopiago sub-district
number into the 7,000.  In the Wabag sub-district, Engas living in
an area comparable to this are in number about 70,000.  This
means that in reaching the people by hiking one reaches only
about one-tenth as many people per mile of mountain hiked.
Actually it is even less than that because the area settled by the
Engas is very densely populated in fertile valleys separated by
mountains where there are no people.  Duna too live in the many
little valleys by nowhere is there any dense population.  Many
hours and days have been spent on camping trips hiking around
the Kopiago circuit, up mountains, down into river gorges, to
establish the work”

The Hewa
The word "Hewa" means stranger.
The Hewa extend into two provinces,  Enga and the Southern Highlands
,

and are a remarkably mobile highlands fringe people. They inhabit the area
north and south of the lower Lagaip River in the most northwesterly corner
of Southern Highlands Province, extending from the junction of the Lagaip,
Strickland and Ok Om rivers east into Enga Province to roughly the
Lagaip–Porgera river junction.
Next
An extended family will live in a communal house, on stilts, 14 ft above the
ground.  The large house is also 36 ft. wide and 26 ft. long.  It is made of
split Pandanus logs tied with cane, which has a thatched roof of Pandanus
leaves.  Men and women live in the same house; however, they are in
separate areas.
The Hewa also engage in pig husbandry, and practice low-intensity swidden
[slash and burn] agriculture based primarily on sweet potato cultivation.
In addition to sweet potato, the Hewa cultivate a variety of local and
introduced crops, including taro, banana, sago, pumpkin, cassava,
breadfruit, corn, pawpaw and a number of leafy greens.  They supplement
their diets through hunting, and spear-fishing in the Lagaip River, which is
relied upon more than gardening.
You can recognize Hewa men by their cone-shaped wigs, which are covered
by a net.  Hewa women wear kuta skirts similar to the Enga women, but
Hewa women wear a knitted string head veil with Job's Tear seed and
cowrie shells sewn around the face line.

Rev. William Wagner speculates on exploratory trip into Hewa territory,
Next
“The most recent of the government patrols into the area established
contacted and counted about nine hundred Hewas in four or five days of
hiking.  We want to go into the area soon and bring the word of truth…it
is going to be a difficult task.  Another language, more hiking and hiking
in a different direction, not to mention the fact that there are no Hewas
who speak Pidgin English, the language we use in making our contact.
That means we have to use two interpreters, one to translate the Pidgin
English we speak into the Duna Language and another to translate what
the first interpreter has said in Duna into Hewa.  There are a few Duna
who speak Hewa and we are told that there are a few Hewas on the
perimeter of their area who speak Duna.  Five of the Hewa came into the
Kopiago recently with the government patrol when it returned and they
have now carried word of the outside world back to their people”

[Excerpt from Wagner Newsletter, December 2, 1964].
Cont'd
“In addition to the Duna work, just recently work among the Hewa came
to light. Up until this time the population of the Hewa [was] just
speculation as patrols by the Administration officers [Australian patrol
officers] had failed to contact more than just a handful of the Hewa.  It is
almost unbelievable to think that in the present age of rockets, satellites,
hydrogen and super bombs, with travel a matter of hours between
continents that there should be a portion of this earth untouched by
outsiders where a people live an insular life with no contact with the
world around them.  The Hewa may as well have lived on another planet
and may as well have watched the world go drifting by...

Rev. Wagner, who is living in Kopiago area while researching the Hewa,
writes his wife Ruth, who is still in Sirunki about his exploratory "Walkabout"
Next
The Hewas just ten months ago were an unknown quantity. Their
presence in a prescribed area was known because they had been seen
from airplanes flying over the area, but no personal contact has been
made with them because they lived over the mountains two days’
hiking distance from Lake Kopiago.  What mountains!  We followed the
advice of our guide on one of our trips and we climbed from the Pori
River up and up over the mountains to return to Kopiago.  We climbed
for six hours, always up and up and at the very top we scaled the
limestone cliff, pulling ourselves up with our hands on top of a ledge
and our toes placed in toeholds in the face of the cliff.  The path was
well defined and at no time were we in any danger of falling, but it was
truly a climb.  We estimate that we climbed about 6,000 feet.  The Pori
River as Papapuka is approximately 3.600 feet and the mountain is over
10,000.  We now know the area better and will not climb that mountain
again.  We plan our trip so as to go completely around the mountain
and return on the other side of it.

Just a note. I am just now back from Hewa.  Terrible hiking, 6 hours
up, up, and up.  Must have climbed 4,000 or 5,000 feet up…  The
Hewa are people who live in houses on stilts.  At first because of the
Pidgin English way of speaking, “Haus bilong em i stap antap long
dewai,” our missionaries thought that their houses were built in trees.
Jerry Arndt, [
who replaced Rev. Wagner while he came in for Kristen’s
birth, the Wagner’s fifth daughter],
said that they do live in houses on
stilts, sometimes as high as 14 ft above the ground.

hiking, and have had the misfortune of training three informants
one after the other so that we have not progressed in the

Highland Axes
The Uaa is the Enga and Duna word for axe.  Early axes were almost
always wood hafted weapons, the heads of which were made of carved
stone chipped to an edge.   As time progressed, metal-hafted and metal-
headed axes became more commonplace. Steel trade store axes have
replaced stone axes in most of New Guinea. Stone was traditionally traded
down from Highland quarries on both sides of the island to the rivers,
swamps and coastal areas where any stone is scarce.  The different stones
have names: Sambi - mottled stone; Morokea - black stone; Kunjina -
black and grey stone [information provided by Kristen Wagner, Mrs. Ruth
Wagner's daughter]

Highland Adzes
The Enga and Duna used adzes for work and war weapons. They were
carved of stone and lashed with cane to a wooden handle. The work adze

Panpipes are widely distributed in the Highlands, but are also found in
many other locales [McLean, 1994: 17-19].
This station in Yaramanda was the home of Missionary Otto Hintze, one
of the first missionaries in the Highlands, who was in charge of this
circuit.
Yaramanda would be the Wagner’s home for the next two months, until
they would continue on to Saka Raiakama to begin a new main station
and a circuit of their own.

 “This little grass house (below) is in Yaramanda, that is the first, that's
where we came to when we came into the Highlands. and a.. Yaramanda
was or is ahh.. a Mission station that was practically the second station
that was ... umm.. started there in the Enga territory.. Otto Hintze was
there, that would have been 1948, 1949, when he was there…so you are
looking out over the valley and the Lai River is there.. This is the gorge
for the Lai River”
“This little grass house (left) is
called ‘Strackman’s House”
and Bill and I lived here before
we went to Saka Raikama.
When we arrived in New
Guinea, we stayed with the
Hintze family.  This picture
was taken at their station in
Yaramanda. We stayed there
with them, ate there, had our
bible study, wonderful
conversations, and
on Sunday, played games. This little grass house is where we slept
because at that time, there were no facilities for other families in theirs.
We just slept there.  The building off to the side is one of Otto's
'Mitianda’  (on the right) It would be where he had church service.”

“I have only one image of the New Guinean Jew’s harp made from
bamboo: it is when my father took me with him to Pausa [area in
the Highlands], for the 25th Anniversary of the missionary work in
New Guinea.  My recollection is faint, but I have a vision of a New
Guinean man dressed in his native dress holding the Jew’s harp up
to his lips with one hand, and with the other hand moving the string.
The sound that was produced, as I dimly remember, was that of
musical twangs.”

The Lutherans in New Guinea
German missionaries of the Neuendettelsau and Rhenish missions
began the work in 1886, entering at two points on the north coast of
what was then the new German colony of East New Guinea. The
inhabitants, Melanesians and Papuans by race, were considered
primitive.  Today in unexplored pockets in the inland mountains, there
still live some of the most primitive people on earth; of all the mission
fields of Asia this is the one where Western civilization has been the
last to come.  The land is mountainous, forested and as might be
expected, thinly populated.  The missionaries faced a tremendous
problem of language.  In 1957, the half a million people populating
the area of the Lutheran church were divided into sixty or eighty
tribes and spoke as many different tongues.  During that time, in a
single church district of 8,000 people four languages are used.  None
of these languages had ever been put into writing.  The missionaries
chose three of the principal languages as “church languages” and
used them and interpreters for their work, adding “pidgin” which is an
adaptation of English.
The story of the development leading up to the remarkable
organization that is the Lutheran Mission New Guinea has a dramatic
history of missionary vision and loyalty, of the bond of faith bringing
aid in the emergencies caused by two world wars, and of the final
union in 1953 of German (Neuendettelsau), Australian (UELCA),  and
the American (ALC, which replaced the Rhenish Mission) missions into
a single internationally staffed and financed (with substantial
subsidies from the LWF) organization.  It was equipped as never
before to carry on in times that was critical for the development of
the New Guinean people and for the church.

The PNG Highlands is one of the most democratic societies on earth. There
are no chiefs, only big men, who are self-made. As a result, an effective
form of wealth distribution has evolved.  To become and remain a big
man, you must give frequent formal feasts in your community, and feasts
mean pork.  As a sign of his status, the big man host wears a special
woven apron when he kills the pigs at these feasts, and the tails of the
pigs are always added to the apron to increase the prestige of the wearer.
It is not possible to ritually kill the pigs unless you wear an apron, and for
this reason, those who do not own one will rent them for the occasion for
as much as Kina 50, about US$20 per day, which is big money in the
Highlands <http://www.tribalartbrokers.net/details.asp?itemId=SIK>.

This station in Yaramanda was the home of Missionary Otto Hintze, one
of the first missionaries in the Highlands, who was in charge of this
circuit.
Yaramanda would be the Wagner’s home for the next two months, until
they would continue on to Saka Raiakama to begin a new main station
and a circuit of their own.

 “This little grass house (below) is in Yaramanda, that is the first, that's
where we came to when we came into the Highlands. and a.. Yaramanda
was or is ahh.. a Mission station that was practically the second station
that was ... umm.. started there in the Enga territory.. Otto Hintze was
there, that would have been 1948, 1949, when he was there…so you are
looking out over the valley and the Lai River is there.. This is the gorge
for the Lai River”
“This little grass house (left) is
called ‘Strackman’s House”
and Bill and I lived here before
we went to Saka Raikama.
When we arrived in New
Guinea, we stayed with the
Hintze family.  This picture
was taken at their station in
Yaramanda. We stayed there
with them, ate there, had our
bible study, wonderful
conversations, and
on Sunday, played games. This little grass house is where we slept
because at that time, there were no facilities for other families in theirs.
We just slept there.  The building off to the side is one of Otto's
'Mitianda’  (on the right) It would be where he had church service.”

Carved stone objects – Mortars and pestles are found buried in Highland’s
agricultural plots.  The stone mortars are often knobbed or ridged around
the side and rim and the pestles and pounders are often simple.  They are
believed to be at least 3,000 years old and suggest a society of seed
grinders, although this practice has not taken place in the region within
living memory.  The mortars are used in magic rituals and are treated as
objects of power [http://www.tribalarts.com/feature/highlands/index.html].

Warfare is a major aspect of Highland life, and shields are the supreme
artistic expression connected with it.  Highland shields are used
exclusively for combat and are not related to ceremonial occasions as
they are in other parts of Melanesia.  During periods of peace they were
usually stored in their owner’s abode above the fire, like this shield.  The
smoke of the fire blackened and hardened the timber so that shields
often lasted a century.  Periods of peace were always unstable due to
ever-changing alliances.  When warfare inevitably erupted, these stored
shields were brought down, repainted, and used.
Highland War Shield
Next
Under the Australian colonial rule policy of “Pacification,” which was
initiated in the Highlands from first contact in the 1930s through
Independence in 1975, large scale inter-tribal warfare all but ceased.
Even the smaller skirmishes were largely contained.  Many shields and
other weapons were burned or discarded during this period, but during
the late 1970s both warfare and shield production began to revive.
Highland shields were traditionally stone-adzed, but the introduction of
steel blades has resulted in little alteration in shape, size, or design

Mrs. Ruth Wagner
Next
Miss Ruth Lilly Prueter was born on March 15, 1926, in Toledo, Ohio.  She
graduated from the University of Toledo with a Bachelor of Education degree
in 1948, teaching grades five and six in the Toledo Public School system
from 1948 to 1954.   In September, 1953, she met William Wagner in West
Bend, Wisconsin, where he had completed a year of vicarage. He graduated
from Concordia Lutheran Seminary in Springfield, Illinois and received his
call to the central highlands of New Guinea.  Ruth and William were married
August 14, 1954, at the Memorial Lutheran Church –LCMS in Toledo, Ohio.
Mission school followed at Concordia Lutheran Seminary, St. Louis, Missouri,
and William was ordained as a pastor in January, 1955, at Greeley,
Colorado.
Starting their life together, the couple served their Lord as missionaries in
the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea for 14 years – 1955 through
1969.  Ruth and her husband were blessed with five daughters, all born in
Papua, New Guinea.
The Wagner family returned to the United States in April, 1969.  Mrs.
Wagner’s teaching career took off in the United States, where she taught in
the inner city in St. Louis, Missouri, while her husband, Reverend William
Wagner, did his Post-graduate study at the St. Louis Seminary, receiving his
M.A.R. degree in 1970.
After his graduation, Reverend Wagner was called as the pastor at St. Peter
Lutheran Church in Gresham, Nebraska, and at Zion Lutheran Church in
Thayer, Nebraska.  While there, Mrs. Ruth Wagner taught Kindergarten and
Remedial Reading in Gresham and Surprise, Nebraska.  The family
remained in Nebraska until 1977, when another move was in store for this
couple and their five children.

==> text/197.txt <==
Reverend Wagner was then called to be Pastor at Grace Lutheran Church in
Liberal, Kansas, and Mrs. Wagner taught at West Middle School for fifteen
[15] years.  She retired from teaching in 1992, but that did not last long -
she was a substitute teacher there as well, later working as a sales
associate in a high-end boutique store.  She left Liberal in 1995, and moved
to Wichita Kansas, where she again substituted, later taking a teaching
position at Bethany Lutheran Church and School until retiring again in 2005.
Mrs. Ruth Wagner is actively retired and involved with church, friends, and
family.
In 2005 and 2006, Mrs. Ruth Wagner donated collections of New Guinean
artifacts to the Lowell D. Holmes Museum of Anthropology, located on the
Wichita State University campus.  Many of the artifacts were gifts that had
been presented to Reverend Wagner by the Enga, Duna, and Hewa
clansmen during his time in New Guinea.
As an educator, the imparting of knowledge is very important to Mrs.
Wagner.  This attribute is an integral part of the mission of the Lowell D.
Holmes Museum of Anthropology.  Although the museum is a teaching
facility where students learn how to become museum professionals, it also
provides an opportunity for visitors to become immersed in different
cultures, thus learning more about the world around them.
The donation of the collections will enable students, scholars, and the public
alike to gain insight into the Wagners' life and vocation.  They will also learn
about Papua New Guinea and about the Western and Southern Highland
peoples who inhabit that region.
