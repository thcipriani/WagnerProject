While the economy is largely subsistence, wealth being connected with
pigs, gardens, etc., there is a kind of money used.

In the Gulf of Papua, off the southern coast of Papua new Guinea, the
shell of a large clam is taken from the coral reefs. This shell is cut and
polished to reveal its golden color. The shell is five or six inches wide.
This shell follows a trade route and has purchase value at each stop.

It would be difficult to determine how a shell found in the Gulf of Papua
reaches the Enga, but it comes to them via a people in the Hagen area
and represents a pig, which means that somewhere a man gave a pig to
obtain the shell. This in then used as money, one shell equalling one pig.
The shell is accepted at face value in paying a bride price, reparations in
the Te Ceremony, obtaining a prized Aga Nut, or Tree Oil, etc.

The Enga later made money by growing and gathering dry blossoms of
the Pyrethrum plant, then sold them to the Australian government as a
knock-down agent in DDT.   The Australian government and the Mission
introduced other 'cash crops' as well.   Listen Below -
