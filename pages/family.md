## Family

The Enga family is a divided family. Women, babies, all small children
and all girls live in the women’s house. Men and boys from five to eight
and older all live in the men’s house. A man will build a women’s house
near to the place where he lives in a men’s house and will have his wife
live there, but there is a division which is hard to overcome.

Discipline is very lax, and it is not uncommon for a young lad to sleep in
his uncle’s house because his father wanted him to do a certain thing or
because his father tried to correct him. However, should a young lad
become a discipline problem for the clan and repeatedly cause strife in
the clan with thefts and misdemeanors, the clan will deal with him and
sometimes deal harshly with him.
