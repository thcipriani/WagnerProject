The houses the Enga people build serve their need in the climate. The
mountains cause the nights to be cold. They build low houses with solid,
more or less windproof walls and a grass roof.

There is only one door to the house with a kyta or crash door built into the
ceiling to the rear of the house. In the event of a fire, the occupants can
break through this door and out of the house, although it is never used
except in the event of a fire.

The front door to the house is an opening in the wall, and the door is
closed by sliding doubled-over banana leaves back and forth on a pole
which is fastened over the opening. Quite often axe-hewn planks are
placed one by one across the doorway in slots made by two upright posts
to close the opening.

A fire built in the main room of the house heats the house. The smoke
finds its way out through the grass, for there is no chimney. These houses
are very warm, even hot, and the Engas are thus able to sleep warmly
without blankets. Food is cooked on the fire and there are no cooking
utensils.
