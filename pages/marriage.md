In Enga society polygyny was practiced. There wasn't a limit on the
number of wives a man could have, but since there was the custom
of paying a bride price, the number of wives was naturally tied up with what
a man was able to afford.

The marriage proper was carried out in the presence of a sorcerer, or
"topori".

A feast of cooked pig, the payment of the bride price, exchange of gifts
and all having been completed, the “topori” says the proper magic
formulas to ensure a good and fruitful married life.

The taro plant, a plant with large leaves and an edible, starchy, tuberous
root figures largely in the wedding ceremony. A man and his newly
acquired bride will go to a secluded place, and there will sit on the ground
with their legs outstretched, facing each other so that the soles of his feet
touch the soles of her feet. They will then plant a taro between their
outstretched legs at the place where the soles of their feet touch.
They then live happily ever after.
