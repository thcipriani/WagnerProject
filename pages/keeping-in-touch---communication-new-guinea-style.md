> Imagine living in a lonely outpost with no near neighbors outside
> a few friendly natives.  No one to talk to over coffee, none of
> your friends around to help out in case of emergency, no
> newspaper, telephone, mailman, corner grocery, what would you
> do? (Dicke, Ed. Mission Accessories).

The Wagners, along with the rest of the missionaries, lived in this type of
situation.  They often lived very far from each other -

> as much as a twenty-hour hike up and down the mountains (Dicke, Ed. Mission Accessories).

How did the missionaries keep in touch?  Well - they communicated
through a receiver, a device similar to a radio.

> At special times of the day, 8 a.m., noonday, and 5 p.m.,  you get
> a chance to talk while everybody listens.  It is the only opportunity
> to get the news and keep in touch with each other. Nurses
> stationed in remote territories can get in touch with a doctor for
> counsel on difficult medical problems and keep him informed on
> patients progress.  Groceries and supplies from the business office
> are ordered by transceiver - saving someone a three, or  four day
> walk.  News was also collected from the 'outside' (Dickie, Ed. Mission Accessories)

The receivers were powered by automobile batteries and their wavelength
was limited to only the mission territory.  The New Guinean field had a
system of ten receivers that were provided by a grant from the Lutheran
Women's Mission League.
