> The Enga concepts of life and the world are practical, earthly concepts.
> They accept the world, the sun, the moon and the stars as something that
> is. Their concept of a higher power is embodied in the “semongo", or the
> spirits of the deceased in their family, in their tribe or among their
> kinsmen. These spirits frequent the places where the deceased lived their
> earthly lives, and can cause illness, death, poor crops, etc..
>
> Their fables, which they tell and retell, deal with matters like planting
> gardens, gathering of produce from the garden, cooking food, eating food,
> or marrying, to name a few. Another type of spirit enters into these fables;
> he is called “putututi” or “kanamongari”. He can change his form and
> become human, an animal, an insect, a bird, or even a tree. The Enga fear
> “putututi” as much as they fear “semongo", as they are both powerful spirits.
