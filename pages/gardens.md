The economy among the Enga people is largely a subsistence economy.
They plant gardens to supply their needs and since gardens grow all year
long, year after year, they can live off their garden.

Sweet potato, similar to the one we know, is the main food in their diet
and there are over 30 varities. Sugar cane, types of beans, taro,
a spinach-like green, and other greens are also eaten. Europeans
introduced the pumpkin, corn, peanuts, and Irish potatoes to the Enga
diet as well.
