Two months later, William Wagner proposed marriage to Ohioan Ruth L.
Prueter and they were married on August 14, 1954 in Memorial Lutheran
Church in Toledo, Ohio.  Ruth, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Henry W.
Prueter, was born and raised in Toledo, Ohio.  She attended the University
of Toledo, graduating in June 1948, with a Bachelor of Education degree.
Afterwards, she taught in the Toledo public schools for six years.

In preparation for their work in the mission field in New Guinea, both Mr.
and Mrs. William Wagner attended the Mission School at Concordia
Seminary, in Saint Louis, from September, 1954 to January, 1955.
William Wagner and his bride, Mrs. Ruth Wagner then returned to
Greeley, Colorado, where William (Bill) Wagner was ordained and
commissioned as a missionary to New Guinea at 3 p.m., February 13,
1955.  (The Lutheran Witness; St. Louis MO., March15, 1955)

Reverend and Mrs. William P. Wagner then left for San Francisco,
California where they boarded a plane for Madang (The Lutheran Witness;
St. Louis MO., March15, 1955).

Their final destination was the Western Highlands of Papua, New Guinea
where they were to work with the Enga, and later make exploratory trips
into the Hewa territories.
