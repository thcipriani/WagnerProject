WHO ARE THE PEOPLE OF ENGA PROVINCE? - An Introduction

After getting settles in Raiakama, the Reverend Willian and Mrs. Wagner
were ready to begin their work as missionaries with the Enga people
of the Enga Province.

Who are the Enga people you ask?  Well, the Enga are the largest linguistic
and cultural group in all of Paupa New Guinea.  They live on the Western side
of the Hagan Range in clan groups.  The Enga people live mostly by
subsistance farming.

The traditional Enga settlement style is that of scattered homesteads
dispersed throughout the landscape. Sweet potato is the staple food,
sometimes (not often) supplemented by pork. Pigs are a culturally valued
item of exchange. It is the elaborate systems of pig exchange that mark
social life in the province.

In Enga society there is a strict segregation of sexes. Husband and wife do
not share the same household unless the couple has tried to adopt the style
of the Europeans. In the true Enga culture, the women and girls live in a
woman's house and the males and boys in a man's house. Husbands and
wives do not walk together; the man always peceding the wife down the
road. Only the wife takes care of the pigs and gardens the sweet potato.
Her husband hunts, grows the sugarcane, builds houses, and prepares the
mounds for his wife’s, or wives' sweet potato vines.

The Ceremonial Sing Sing can last for days, during which time many pigs,
the geatest symbol of wealth, will be presented as gifts. Men will slaughter
the pigs and prepare a feast of pork. The women will bring the bananas,
greens, and mapu [sweet potato] to add to the feast.

But before a feast can begin, preparations will need to take place. The
men will dig a pit in the ground, and firewood and rocks are placed in the
bottom. When the rocks are heated, layers of vegetables, pork, and greens
are placed in the pit and covered, first with large leaves to protect the
food, and then a layer of insulating dirt is added over the top.

The food will cook for three or more hours, and when it is ready, the dirt
and leaves are carefully removed. The food is then removed from the pit
and guests will use plates of large leaves. Any leftover food will be sent
home with guests, indicating to all, the wealth and generosity of the host

ENGA CONCEPTS: Overview

[Excerpt from Wagner Newsletter, Sept 24, 1963].

The Enga concepts of life and the world are practical, earthly concepts.
They accept the world, the sun, the moon and the stars as something that
is. Their concept of a higher power is embodied in the “semongo", or the
spirits of the deceased in their family, in their tribe or among their
kinsmen. These spirits frequent the places where the deceased lived their
earthly lives, and can cause illness, death, poor crops, etc..

Their fables, which they tell and retell, deal with matters like planting
gardens, gathering of produce from the garden, cooking food, eating food,
or marrying, to name a few. Another type of spirit enters into these fables;
he is called “putututi” or “kanamongari”. He can change his form and
become human, an animal, an insect, a bird, or even a tree. The Enga fear
“putututi” as much as they fear “semongo", as they are both powerful spirits.

Birth

Women give birth to children in a spot removed from the house, a place
overgrown with a considerable growth of wild cane bushes and tall
grasses.  If she has difficutly, she can cry for help, someone may come.
It is not uncommon for a woman to have given birth to six or seven
children and have only two reach maturity.  A child is not named at
birth; the parents wait a month or two to see if the child lives before
naming him/her.

Family

The Enga family is a divided family. Women, babies, all small children
and all girls live in the women’s house. Men and boys from five to eight
and older all live in the men’s house. A man will build a women’s house
near to the place where he lives in a men’s house and will have his wife
live there, but there is a division which is hard to overcome.

Discipline is very lax, and it is not uncommon for a young lad to sleep in
his uncle’s house because his father wanted him to do a certain thing or
because his father tried to correct him. However, should a young lad
become a discipline problem for the clan and repeatedly cause strife in
the clan with thefts and misdemeanors, the clan will deal with him and
sometimes deal harshly with him.

Childhood

Children stay with the mother and the mother nurses them for at least
four years before they are weaned.  After the children are weaned, the
boys stay with their mother until they are able to look after their own needs
to a large extent.  The exact age when a young lad leaves his mother and
starts living with his father in the men's house cannot be determined.  It
varies from about five to eight years of age.

Generally the children are carefree and have little responsibility.  The father
shows the boy how to preform the work of the men, and the mother shows
the girl how to do "woman's work."  Girls are taught to carry firewood, weed
the garden, and draw drinking water from the spring. Children have much
time to play.
